At Wyoming, both Gipson brothers played cornerback from 2008-2010 for the Wyoming Cowboys football team. Gipson’s season year in 2011 proved to be his best statistically with 95 total tackles (73 solo 22 assist) with 0.5 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 3 interceptions. During his senior season, Tashaun started the season by playing at the cornerback position, but for the final 8 games of the season he played at the safety position. Gipson had 3 interceptions as a junior in 2010, and 3 interceptions as a sophomore in 2009. As a freshman Tashaun did not have any interceptions, however along with his brother, Marcell, the Gipson brothers both tied for the team lead in passes defensed with 10 each. Gipson started every game of his collegiate career at Wyoming.</p><p>He made his professional regular season debut in the Cleveland Browns’ season-opener against the Philadelphia Eagles and made his first career tackle on Brandon Boykin during a 29-yard kickoff return in the first quarter of their 17–16 loss. In Week 3, Gipson made six combined tackles during a 24–14 loss against the Buffalo Bills. He earned increased playing time after Eric Hagg had an underwhelming performance in the first two games. The following week, Gipson made two solo tackles before leaving the 23–16 loss in the second quarter after sustaining a knee injury. His injury sidelined him for the next five games (Weeks 5–9). On November 25, 2012, Gipson earned his first career start in place of free safety Usama Young and recorded two solo tackles in a 20–14 win against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The following week, he made his second consecutive start and collected a season-high eight combined tackles during a 20–17 win at the Oakland Raiders. In Week 14, he made two combined tackles, deflected a pass, and recorded his first career interception off a pass by quarterback Brady Quinn in the Browns’ 30–7 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. On December 31, 2012, the Cleveland Browns announced the firing of head coach Pat Shurmur and general manager Tom Heckert after the Browns finished the season with a 5–11 record. He finished his rookie season with 33 combined tackles (26 solo), a pass deflection, and an interception in ten games and three starts.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tashaun Gipson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tengku</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mushadad</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Safety</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1990</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Bernardino</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Marcell Gipson, Anitra Gipson, Mike Gipson, Teriyon Gipson, Taneah Gipson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tashuan Gipson, Jr., Nala Gipson</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tashaun Gipson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
