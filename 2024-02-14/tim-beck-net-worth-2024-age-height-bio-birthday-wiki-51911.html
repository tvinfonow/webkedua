Beck was born in Youngstown, Ohio on March 14, 1966. He was a graduate of Cardinal Mooney High School.&nbsp;Other players Bo Pelini, Carl Pelini, Bob Stoops, Mark Stoops along with Mike Stoops also graduated from Cardinal Mooney.</p><p>After having his first head coach title secured, Beck returned to the college coaching ranks in 1996, accepting an assistant coaching job with Missouri State, and was appointed the offensive coordinator during the season of 1998.&nbsp;In his brief tenure as the offensive coordinator for MSU the Bears recorded 4,542 all-purpose offensive yards, which was the fourth-highest record in the school’s history of 91 years.</p><p>In 2005, Beck returned to the college football coaching arena by accepting the position of wide receivers coach at the University of Kansas. The Jayhawks had been struggling for consistency, posting no conference wins in 2002, losing the bowl game in their 6–7 campaign of 2003, and missing bowl eligibility in the 4–7 season of 2004. Beck’s receivers helped the 2005 Kansas team to a 7–5 record and their first bowl win since 1995. In 2006, four different Jayhawks receivers caught 24 or more passes, though the 6–6 team was not extended a bowl invitation. In 2007 Beck was also appointed as the Passing Game Coordinator at Kansas, and the season proved to be a breakthrough year for the Jayhawks. Kansas finished 12–1 with the second-best scoring offense nationally, shared the Big 12 Conference North division title with Missouri, and secured a final #7 ranking in both the AP and Coaches polls with their 24–21 win over #5 Virginia Tech in the 2008 Orange Bowl.</p><p>When Bo Pelini was named as Nebraska’s 32nd head football coach for the program’s turnaround 2008 season, Beck accepted the position of running backs coach for the Cornhuskers. In his first season, the Cornhuskers averaged 169.8 running yards per game, with three of the team’s running backs amassing over 450 yards on the year and placing Nebraska as the leading ground yardage team of the conference’s north division. 2009 saw the average fall slightly to 147.1 running yards per game, but thanks in part to Nebraska’s effective defensive game this was still enough to outgain all but three of the season’s opponents on the ground. Running back Roy Helu, Jr. recorded 1,147 yards on the year, while two Cornhusker true freshman backs secured a pair of touchdowns each for the first time since 1993.</p><p align=justify>Beck began his coaching career in football by working as an assistant coach at Miramar High School, located in Miramar, Florida.&nbsp;After two years, Beck advanced to the college coaching ranks after taking the position of the outside linebackers coach as well as punters’ coach with the Illinois State Redbirds.&nbsp;One year after, Beck moved to his first post at an Big 12 Conference school when Beck was enlisted to the Kansas State program as a graduate assistant by Wildcats head coach Bill Snyder.&nbsp;At Kansas State that Beck first collaborated with his future Nebraska co-worker Carl Pelini.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tim Beck</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tim</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Beck</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Youngstown</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Haylie Marie</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tim Beck ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
