Regarded as one of the fastest bowlers of his era, helped carry Pakistan’s national team in the early 2000s.</p><p>He played alongside <a href=#>Shahid Afridi</a> on Pakistan’s national team.</p><p>A good student, Akhtar was admitted to the Asghar Mall College, but disrupted his studies to attend trials for the PIA team’s Karachi division to be held in Lahore. Lacking the money for a bus ticket, he waited for the bus to start and got onto the roof. After some struggle, starting his List A career during the 1993/1994 season and his First-class career during the 1994/1995 one, he caught the eye of Majid Khan, then the chief executive of the PCB, and after a good performance for the Pakistan A team’s tour of England, in 1996, he was rewarded his maiden Test cap against the West Indies, in 1997.</p><p>Considering his subsequent high profile in cricket, Akhtar’s test career started rather modestly. He was first picked to play on his home ground in Rawalpindi during the 2nd Test of the West Indies 1997/98 tour of Pakistan. He was subsequently included in the tour of South Africa during the winter of 1998, where he played in all three Tests. He was notably the spearhead of a depleted Pakistani bowling attack in the Peshawar Test against the visiting Australians later in 1998, where Mark Taylor scored his famous unbeaten 334 in Australia’s first innings. Subsequently, after 8 tests and 16 innings, Akhtar had accumulated only 18 wickets.</p><p align=justify>He was born and raised in Punjab, Pakistan. He married Shoaib Akhtar in 2014.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shoaib Akhtar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shoaib</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Akhtar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cricket Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rawalpindi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pakistan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mohammad Akhtar, Hameeda Awan</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Shumaila Akhtar, Shoaib Akhtar, Tahir Akhtar, Obaid Akhtar, Shahid Akhtar</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rubab Khan</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Muhammad Mikaeel Ali</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Shoaib Akhtar ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It was followed by high-class bowling performances in Sharjah and later in the 1999 Cricket World Cup.</p><h2>Shoaib Akhtar Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Shoaib Akhtar is one of the <strong>richest Cricket Player</strong> from Pakistan. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Shoaib Akhtar</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He made his Test debut on November 29, 1997 against West Indies.</p><p align=justify>His career was somewhat controversial as he was considered to be a poor team player by a number of critics.</p><p align=justify>Shoaib Akhtar ( pronunciation (help ·info ) ; born 13 August 1975) is a Pakistani cricket commentator, YouTuber, and former cricketer who played all formats of the game over a fourteen year career. He is recognized as the fastest bowler in the history of cricket, delivering a world record top speed of 161.3 km/h (100.23 mph) in a pool match against England during the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Akhtar was nicknamed “Rawalpindi Express” and “Tiger” as a tribute to his hometown and fast bowling. He is also the first bowler to break the 100&nbsp;mph barrier, doing so twice in his career.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cricket Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Akhtar has played for three English county cricket clubs: Somerset in 2001, Durham in 2003 and 2004 and Worcestershire in 2005. He did achieve his moments of success, such as taking 5 wickets for 35 runs for Durham against Somerset in the National League in 2003 and claiming 6 wickets for 16 runs in the same competition for Worcestershire against Gloucestershire two years later, but he suffered from fitness problems, as well as a perception that he was less than interested in his task. This was particularly the case at Worcestershire: chairman John Elliott said “Players like that are no good to our club. In fact, Akhtar has been no good for any club he’s been at. He’s a superstar and just does what he wants.”</p><p>In 2002, he was selected for the Pakistan team against Australia and achieved a small amount of success. However the team performed poorly during the 2003 Cricket World Cup and after the tournament he was dropped from the Pakistan squad. He was selected back into the Pakistan squad as they had no choice in the 2003 Test match series against New Zealand, but struggled in a losing Test series against India in 2004. The series ended with a controversy when he left the field citing an injury leading to suspicions by former Pakistan captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, about his commitment to the team. As a result, his relationship with Inzamam-ul-Haq and former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer deteriorated. A medical panel was set up by the Pakistan Cricket Board to investigate the nature of his injury, however Pakistan officials dispelled all suspicions. In 2005, Akhtar regained his reputation as a fast bowler for his side. Playing in a three Test home series against England, he made a series of impressive bowling performances. His effective use of slower deliveries proved to be unplayable by the English batsmen. Akhtar emerged as the highest wicket taker of the series with seventeen wickets. His comeback was also remarkable as prior to his return, he had been criticised from all corners; such as by the Worcestershire chairman John Elliot for his celebrity attitude and lack of commitment to the team. His performance was also acknowledged by the English captain Michael Vaughan, who remarked “I thought he (Shoaib) was a big difference between the two teams”. He is also known as one of only three bowlers to have ever broken the 100&nbsp;mph barrier in cricket history, with a delivery of 100.2&nbsp;mph, during a one-day international against England in World cup 2003</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Shoaib Akhtar height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Shoaib <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Akhtar made his Test debut in November 1997 as an opening fast bowler and played his first One Day International three months later. Akhtar has been involved in several controversies during his career, often accused of unsportsmanlike conduct, despite his commendations for significantly impacting games in Pakistan’s favour. Akhtar was sent home during a Test match series in Australia in 2005 for alleged poor attitude. A year later, he was embroiled in a drug scandal after testing positive for the performance-enhancing substance nandrolone. However, the ban imposed on him was lifted on appeal.</p><p align=justify>He was sent back from the 2005 Australia tour with a hamstring injury amid rumours of indiscipline, lack of commitment and attitudinal complaints. He was subsequently fined by the Pakistan Cricket Board for avoiding a late night curfew. The rest of his cricketing career was riddled with ankle and knee injuries which forced him to undergo a surgery in February 2006, until finally he was banned for two years for allegedly using performance-enhancing drugs.</p><h2>Who is Shoaib Akhtar Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Shoaib Akhtar</strong> married to <strong>Rubab Khan </strong>.

In a triangular series in 2003 held in Sri Lanka, he was caught ball tampering making him the second player in cricket to be banned on ball tampering charges.

Shoaib Akhtar celebrates birthday on August 13 of every year.</p><p align=justify>On 5 December 2006 Akhtar and Asif were acquitted by the tribunal appointed to review their appeals. After a clear hearing from Akhtar’s lawyer Abid Hassan Minto, the three-man committee, voted two to one in favour of the acquittal. Justice Fakhruddin Ebrahim, committee head, and Haseeb Ahsan, former Test cricketer, were in favour of the acquittal. The third member, Danish Zaheer, differed. “Exceptional circumstances” were cited including discrepancies between the instantaneous offence charges of doping that were laid and the quick delivery of a very harsh verdict. The complete drug testing procedure was concluded to have been technically flawed as it did not follow standard procedures. Other established facts by the committee included that the duo were not aware of the banned drug to be present in their supplements because the Pakistan Cricket Board itself had not informed them of the dangers of contaminated supplements.</p><h3>Who is Shoaib Akhtar wife?</h3><p>Rubab Khan</p><h3>Who is fastest bowler in the world?</h3><p><b>Shoaib Akhtar</b>, Pakistan (161.3 kmph) In the 2003 World Cup against England, Akhtar became the first bowler in cricket history to breach the 100-mph barrier as he bowled a 161.3 kmph (100.2 mph) delivery at Nick Knight, who defended the ball on the leg-side.</p><h3>What is the highest speed of Shoaib Akhtar?</h3><p>Akhtar holds the record with <b>161.3 kmph</b> against England in the 2003 ICC World Cup.</p><h3>Why was Shoaib Akhtar banned in England?</h3><p>Oct. 2003: Banned for one Test and two ODIs for <b>using obscene and offensive language towards South African Paul Adams</b> in Lahore Test.
