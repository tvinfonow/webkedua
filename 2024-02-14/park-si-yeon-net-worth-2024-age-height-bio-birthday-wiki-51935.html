But Park continued to work, appearing in more dramas and making her film debut in the 2006 quirky comedy-horror-musical The Fox Family; gradually her acting showed marked improvement. At first constantly struggling to memorize her lines, Park has admitted that she became more relaxed in her approach to acting, and is able to “feel” her characters better. She became known for playing women who drove men to their destruction and misfortune: In the gangster film A Love, the lover of Park’s character goes to prison after defending her, in the MBC drama Bitter Sweet Life, she was a gold-digging mistress with a lonely soul, in spy film parody Dachimawa Lee, she was a sexy agent, and in the KBS drama The Slingshot, she sacrifices herself and becomes the enemy’s possession in exchange for her boyfriend’s freedom. Park smilingly said, “I personally don’t like femme fatales. Men should be happy because of women, not unhappy.”</p><h2>Park Si-yeon Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Park Si-yeon is one of the <strong>richest Movie Actress</strong> from South Korea.
