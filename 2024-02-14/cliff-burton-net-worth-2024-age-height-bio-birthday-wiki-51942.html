Who is Cliff Burton dating now & how much money does Cliff Burton have?</p><h2>Cliff Burton Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Cliff Burton</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Bassist</strong> who was born on <strong>February 10, 1962</strong> in Castro Valley, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Bassist for Metallica in the 1980s , who was killed in a tragic car crash in the year 1986.&nbsp;He was a part of album Kill ‘Em all, Ride the Lightning, and Master of Puppets.</p><p>His replacement was&nbsp;Jason Newsted&nbsp;as bassist of Metallica following his death.</p><p>While still a student at Castro Valley High School, Burton formed his first band called EZ-Street. The band took its name from a Bay Area topless bar. Other members of EZ-Street included future Faith No More guitarist “Big” Jim Martin as well as Faith No More and Ozzy Osbourne drummer Mike Bordin. Burton and Martin continued their musical collaboration after becoming students at Chabot College in Hayward, California. Their second band, Agents of Misfortune, entered the Hayward Area Recreation Department’s Battle of the Bands contest in 1981. Their audition was recorded on video and features some of the earliest footage of Burton’s playing style. The video also shows Burton playing parts of what would soon be two Metallica songs: his signature bass solo, “(Anesthesia) – Pulling Teeth”, and the chromatic intro to “For Whom the Bell Tolls”. Burton joined his first major band, Trauma, in 1982. Burton recorded the track “Such a Shame” with the band on the second Metal Massacre compilation.</p><p>In 1982, Trauma traveled to Los Angeles to perform at the Whisky a Go Go. Among those in attendance were James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, both members of Metallica, which had formed the previous year. Upon hearing, as Hetfield described it, “this amazing shredding” (which later became “(Anesthesia) – Pulling Teeth”), the two went in search of what they thought was an amazing guitar player. When they learned that what they had heard was a bass solo by Burton, they decided to recruit him for their own band. They asked him to replace departed bassist Ron McGovney, and since Burton thought that Trauma was “starting to get a little commercial”, he agreed. The idea of having to move to Los Angeles did not sit well with him, and said he would join only if the band would relocate from Los Angeles to his native San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica, eager to have Burton in the band, left their origin of Los Angeles to make a home in El Cerrito, a town located across the bay from San Francisco.</p><p align=justify>He was the son of his parents Jan Burton and Ray Burton and had two older siblings, Scott and Connie.&nbsp;Scott, his brother, Scott was killed at the age of 13. Cliff was 13 years old.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cliff Burton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cliff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Burton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bassist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Castro Valley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Cliff Burton ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
