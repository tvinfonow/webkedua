Tait had partially formed this band around 1997. One of the original members was guitarist Pete Stewart (from the hard rock band Grammatrain), who is featured on the first album, but absent from the second one due to his departing the band to work on his own solo projects. In 2006, Tait announced that they were working on an album titled Loveology. Though Michael is now touring as frontman for the Newsboys, he still has plans to release Loveology. In an interview with John Dibiase of Jesusfreakhideout.com, he stated that Loveology is still in the works, and will be a separate project from the Newsboys. In the interview Michael said, “Loveology is going to become something we’re going to be writing about very soon. I can’t tell you now, but it’s a project with the boys and I and Ben Moody, which is another whole music project.”</p><p>Michael Tait met Toby McKeehan in 1984 while he was in high school in the Washington, D.C. area, and together they began creating music. Michael Tait and Toby McKeehan both met Kevin Max while attending Liberty University in the mid-1980s. Together, all three formed the four-time Grammy winning band DC Talk and released 5 acclaimed studio albums. In 2000, the band announced a hiatus with the release of Intermission: the Greatest Hits while all three members devoted themselves to solo projects. The band has not toured together since 2001 (except for one time in Redmond, Washington in 2005 and when TobyMac made a surprise guest appearance at Winter Jam in 2010 in Nashville and sang “Jesus Freak” with Tait). DC Talk has recorded 3 songs together since the announcement of the hiatus including the remix of “Atmosphere” on TobyMac’s 2004 album Welcome to Diverse City and a cover of the Prince song “The Cross” on Kevin Max’s 2007 album The Blood.

I immediately sought wise counsel and flooded the heavens with endless prayers for insight and vision, and I soon received a clear and definite peace. Last weekend, I had the opportunity to perform my first show as Newsboys’ frontman to an audience of 12,000 people. I was completely wrapped in love and support by Newsboys’ fans, who are clearly the best fans on the planet. Now I know this is exactly where I belong in this new and wonderful moment in my life’s history.
