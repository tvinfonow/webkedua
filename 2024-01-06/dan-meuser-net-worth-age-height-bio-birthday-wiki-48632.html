Daniel P. Meuser (born on February 10, 1964) is an American politician and businessman who is the U.S Representative for the 9th district of Pennsylvania’s Congress.&nbsp;A Republican He was previously secretary of Revenue in the cabinet of Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett.&nbsp;He was previously President of the Pride Mobility Corporation, a manufacturer of motorized wheelchairs in the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metro area of Pennsylvania, and currently serves the company as a board member and consultant.&nbsp;He has also testified before Congress on the importance of federal policies regarding rights and the care of disabled persons.&nbsp;In November of 2018 the congressman has been elected to House of Representatives in U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p>When Meuser was running for the 10th congressional district in 2008 it was located in the district that was the 11th of Congress in which Lou Barletta was running for Congress against Paul Kanjorski, the incumbent.&nbsp;Meuser stated that he would live in the district when the voters cast their ballots in the primary election. He bought a home located in Harvey’s Lake, which is in the 10th congressional district, however, he resides at Dallas, Pennsylvania.</p><p>As Secretary, Meuser helped reform the Department of Revenue and turned the Department into the most improved revenue Department in the Country. The Council On State Taxation (COST) gave PA an A- rating thanks to legislation that Secretary Meuser helped pass as well as the reforms he put into place. Residents of Pennsylvania raised speculation to his appointment by Tom Corbett due to the fact that he was one of the largest contributors in Tom Corbett’s 2009–2010 campaign, making a total of 26 contributions totaling $76,394. There is concern over a recent $103 million computer modernization system for the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue being performed by Accenture, a global technology consultant which had previously been fired by the state of Maryland for a similar project due to wasteful spending and missed deadlines.</p><p>In 2010, Politics Magazine cited him as a “Former Congressional candidate and northeast PA money man”.</p><p align=justify>Meuser was running in the race for GOP nomination for Pennsylvania’s 10th congressional district after announcing the launch of his campaign in September 2007.&nbsp;Meuser was disqualified in the Republican primary by Businessman Chris Hackett, who went losing to Democratic incumbent Chris Carney in November 2008.&nbsp;Meuser prominently emphasized his conservative stance, even using the name of Ronald Reagan and strongly emphasizing his work with Pride Mobility as part of the larger campaign to support the concept of small-scale government and low tax.&nbsp;The endorsements he received comprised numerous famous Pennsylvania conservatives, including particularly the former U.S.&nbsp;Senator Rick Santorum and then-Hazleton mayor Lou Barletta.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dan Meuser</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Meuser</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Babylon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Shelley Meuser</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Dan Meuser ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

On the night of the primary, the nail-bitingly close returns—despite initially displaying a comfortable Meuser lead—were soon indicating a virtual tie for some time throughout the night, with merely more than 100 votes separating the candidates at one point. However, as time passed, Hackett took a lead that seemed to gradually grow within hours. By roughly 11:15&nbsp;p.m. ET, local news media and the Associated Press dubbed Hackett, who had garnered 52 percent of the vote to Meuser’s 48 percent, the projected winner of the primary.</p><p>In October 2017, Dan Meuser announced that he would run as a Republican to represent Pennsylvania’s 9th congressional district.
