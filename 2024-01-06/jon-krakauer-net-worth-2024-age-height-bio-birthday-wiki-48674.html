Michael Quinn, a historian who was excommunicated in 1993, who wrote that “The tragic reality is that there have been occasions when Church leaders, teachers, and writers have not told the truth they knew about difficulties of the Mormon past, but have offered to the Saints instead a mixture of platitudes, half-truths, omissions, and plausible denials”. Krakauer wrote, “I happen to share Dr. Quinn’s perspective”.</p><p>A candid recollection of the event was published in Outside magazine and, later, in the book Into Thin Air. By the end of the 1996 climbing season, fifteen people had died on the mountain, making it the deadliest single year in Everest history to that point. This has been exceeded by the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche, and the 2015 earthquake avalanche disaster in which nineteen people were killed. Krakauer publicly criticized the commercialization of Mount Everest following this tragedy.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jon Krakauer height</b> Not available right now.
