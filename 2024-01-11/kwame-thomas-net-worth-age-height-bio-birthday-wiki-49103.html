Kwame Blair Thomas (born 28 September 1995) is an English professional footballer who currently plays for League One club Burton Albion</p><p>On 29 July 2015, Thomas joined League One side Blackpool on a six-month loan deal. He made 22 appearances for the “Tangerines”, which included six starts. He was recalled early from his loan in November, much to “Pool” manager Neil McDonald’s disappointment, despite Thomas’s failure to score at Bloomfield Road. Back with Derby he helped Rory Delap’s under-21 side to win the 2015–16 Professional Development League 2 title, but left Pride Park after he was released in the summer.</p><p>Thomas returned to the National League on a one-month loan at Solihull Moors on 17 November 2017. He scored on his Moors debut on 18 November, to salvage a 1–1 draw at Maidstone United in Mark Yates’s first game as manager; assistant manager Tim Flowers said that Thomas was “unplayable” and well worthy of his one-yard tap-in goal. The loan deal was extended by a further month on 5 January. He left Coventry after his contract was terminated by mutual consent on 1 February 2018. He made an immediate return to Damson Park and ended the 2017–18 campaign with four goals in 27 appearances for Solihull.</p><p>Having struggled again with injury problems in the 2017–18 pre-season, he found himself low down on new manager Mark Robins’s pecking order following the arrivals of Duckens Nazon and Tony Andreu, and was limited to a single start in the EFL Trophy. Robins said that “he has got to go out and try to get some football because his history at the moment is he hasn’t played enough games and he breaks down with injuries”. On 8 September, he joined National League side Sutton United on a one-month loan deal. However the loan spell at Gander Green Lane was described as a “disappointing” one as he was limited to just two league starts, featuring in the full 90 minutes only once.</p><p align=justify>A tall and physical player, he represented England at under-16, under-17 and under-20 level and was part of England’s Under-20 Four Nations Tournament success in October 2014. At club level he came through the Derby County Academy to make his professional debut in the Championship in November 2014. He spent time on loan at Notts County and Blackpool, before leaving Derby for Coventry City in July 2016. He spent the first half of the 2016–17 season injured and Coventry went on to be relegated out of League One. He spent the next season on loan at National League sides Sutton United and Solihull Moors, before he was allowed to join Solihull on a permanent basis in February 2018. He was released by the Moors at the end of the 2018–19 campaign, following a brief loan spell at Kidderminster Harriers.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kwame Thomas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kwame</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Thomas</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1995</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nottingham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nottingham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kwame Thomas ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

On 22 October 2019 he scored his first two goals for the club in a 1-7 win over Southend.</p><h2>Kwame Thomas Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kwame Thomas is one of the <strong>richest Association Football Player</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kwame Thomas</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Born in England, Thomas is of Jamaican descent. Thomas has represented England at under-16, under-17, and under-20 levels. He scored two goals for the under-20s, in friendlies against Romania and the United States. He played in all three of England’s games in the Under-20 Four Nations Tournament in October 2014, which England won after finishing ahead of Germany, Netherlands and Turkey. He was named in Aidy Boothroyd’s squad for the 2015 Toulon Tournament in France and was an unused substitute up until the third-place play-off match at Stade Mayol, which he started; England finished fourth after losing 2–1 to the United States.</p><p align=justify>Having made progress through Derby County academy following his two years as a scholar, Thomas signed his first professional contract in the summer of 2014, just months after receiving the club’s Under-21s Player of the Year award. On 29 November 2014, Thomas made his debut as a 66th-minute substitute in a Championship defeat to Leeds United, missing a good chance to score with ten minutes left to play. On 12 January 2015, Thomas joined League One club Notts County on a one-month youth loan. On 20 January, he was sent off for a second bookable offence in a 0–0 draw at Doncaster Rovers after showing a delayed response to being substituted – “Magpies” manager Shaun Derry was also dismissed for protesting the decision; assistant manager Greg Abbott theorised that referee Richard Clark had not realised Thomas had already been booked when he initially showed the yellow card. He made his return to Derby after one month at Meadow Lane as “Rams” striker Chris Martin was injured and manager Steve McClaren needed cover up front.</p><p align=justify>On 1 July 2016, Thomas signed a two-year contract with Coventry City. Manager Tony Mowbray said that “he has a lot of assets and it’s a question of moulding him in the right way because I think he’s got the potential to be a really good footballer”. However he was hit with an abdominal injury five minutes into his second substitute appearance for the “Sky Blues” and spent the next six months in recovery. He marked his recovery with his first goal for Russell Slade’s side in a 3–2 defeat at Oldham Athletic on 11 February. Seven days later he proved to be a “revelation” after helping Coventry to record their first win in 16 games, as he and namesake George Thomas shared City’s two goals in a 2–1 victory over Gillingham at the Ricoh Arena. He ended the 2016–17 season with three goals in 14 games as Coventry were relegated out of League One.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On 4 February 2020, Thomas signed for Burton Albion on a six-month deal.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kwame Thomas height</b> Not available right now.
