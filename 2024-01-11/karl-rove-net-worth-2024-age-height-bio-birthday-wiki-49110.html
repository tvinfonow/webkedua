Through the University’s Hinckley Institute of Politics, he got an internship with the Utah Republican Party. That position, and contacts from the 1968 Bennett campaign, helped him land a job in 1970 on Ralph Tyler Smith’s unsuccessful re-election campaign for Senate from Illinois against Democrat Adlai E.

Rove stated that although he loved his mother, she was seriously flawed, undependable and, at times, unstable. In December 1969, after a heated fight with his wife, the man Rove had known as his father left the family and divorced Rove’s mother soon afterwards. Rove’s mother moved back to Nevada, and his siblings briefly lived with relatives after the divorce. Rove learned from his aunt and uncle that the man who had raised him was not his biological father; both he and his older brother Eric were the children of another man. Rove has expressed great love and admiration for his adoptive father and for “how selfless” his love had been. Rove’s father and mother expressed deep regret over the failure of the marriage and briefly tried dating each other after the divorce, but they refused to explain the breakup of the marriage, only stating that they still “loved each other dearly.” Rove was unable to convince his parents to get back together, as they were adamant about the divorce, a situation which Rove still does not understand. Rove’s relationship with his adoptive father was briefly strained for a few months following the divorce, but they maintained a very close relationship for the rest of his life.</p><p>In the fall of 1970, Rove used a false identity to enter the campaign office of Democrat Alan J. Dixon, who was running for Treasurer of Illinois. He stole 1000 sheets of paper with campaign letterhead, printed fake campaign rally fliers promising “free beer, free food, girls and a good time for nothing”, and distributed them at rock concerts and homeless shelters, with the effect of disrupting Dixon’s rally. (Dixon eventually won the election.) Rove’s role would not become publicly known until August 1973 when Rove told the Dallas Morning News. In 1999 he said, “It was a youthful prank at the age of 19 and I regret it.” In his memoir, Rove wrote that when he was later nominated to the Board for International Broadcasting by President George H.W. Bush, Senator Dixon did not kill his nomination. In Rove’s account, “Dixon displayed more grace than I had shown and kindly excused this youthful prank.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Karl Rove height</b> Not available right now.

In a 2002 Deseret News interview, Rove explained, “I was the Olympus High chairman for (former U.S. Sen.) Wallace F. Bennett’s re-election campaign, where he was opposed by the dynamic, young, aggressive political science professor at the University of Utah, J.D. Williams.” Bennett was reelected to a third six-year term in November 1968. Through Rove’s campaign involvement, Bennett’s son, Robert “Bob” Foster Bennett—a future United States Senator from Utah—would become a friend. Williams would later become a mentor to Rove.</p><p align=justify>Rove traveled extensively, participating as an instructor at weekend seminars for campus conservatives across the country.
