In 1980, after George failed in his attempt to join the Metropolitan Police, he posed as a policeman, having obtained false warrant cards. For this he was arrested and prosecuted. In May 1980, he appeared in court clad in glam rock clothing and untruthfully stated his name to be Paul Gadd, and stated his occupation as ‘unemployed musician’ and former managing director of a company that handled three rock bands. At Kingston Magistrates’ Court he was convicted and fined £25. In the early 1980s he appeared in a local newspaper claiming to be the winner of the British Karate Championship. He gave his name as Paul Gadd and his occupation as ‘a singer with the band Xanadu and a session musician with the Electric Light Orchestra’. He was exposed as a fraud by another newspaper. He then assumed the identity of the cousin of Electric Light Orchestra singer Jeff Lynne and created a fictional company called Xanadu Constructional and Mechanical Engineers. In 1980, George joined the Territorial Army, but was discharged the following year. He then adopted the persona of SAS member Tom Palmer, one of the soldiers who ended the 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege. George was charged with two counts of indecent assault in June 1981; he was acquitted of indecent assault against one woman, and convicted of indecent assault against another woman, for which he received a three-month sentence, suspended for two years.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Barry George</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Christopher</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dye</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Barry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Alfred George, Margaret George</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michelle Diskin</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Itsuko Toide</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Barry George ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Barry George celebrates birthday on April 15 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In March 2006, George’s lawyers sought an appeal on fresh evidence based on medical examinations suggesting he was not capable of committing the crime because of his mental disabilities. The defence brought in neuropsychiatrist Michael Kopelman to dispute the prosecution’s claim that George showed signs of “histrionics, paranoia and narcissism” and had a personality disorder. Kopelman testified that “[He] described to me that he can be aware of what’s going on around him but he just can’t respond”, and concluded that George was not calculating enough to have committed the crime. A second defence argument was that two new witnesses say they saw armed police at the scene when George was arrested, contrary to official reports about the circumstances of his arrest – the Metropolitan Police maintain there were no armed officers present during the arrest of George. There was scientific evidence alleged to link Barry George to the murder in the form of a single microscopic particle of what was said to have been gunshot residue, together with evidence as to the character of a fibre found on his clothing. It was argued by the defence that the presence of armed officers and their involvement in his arrest might have been responsible for the gunshot residue.</p>You may read full biography about Barry George from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfl66zvthmnp6nopyycA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=/2024-01-11/barry-shabaka-henley-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-49111.html>&#171;&nbsp;Barry Shabaka Henley Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a>
