Outfielder who made his MLB debut in 2013 for the Tampa Bay Rays, known for his incredible center field defense.</p><p>Reliever <a href=#>Fernando Rodney</a> was his teammate on the Rays.</p><p>The Tampa Bay Rays selected Kiermaier in the 31st round of the 2010 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. Purdue again offered Kiermaier a scholarship, but he decided to sign with the Rays instead of transferring to Purdue. Kiermaier spent the 2013 season in Class AA and Class AAA, and was named the best defensive player in the Rays’ organization and the Most Valuable Player of the Montgomery Biscuits of the Class AA Southern League. With Montgomery, he played 97 games, batting .307 with five home runs and 28 RBI. In AAA, he played 39 games with the Durham Bulls, batting .263 with a home run and 13 RBI.</p><p>Considering him the top defensive outfielder in their organization – including the major league club and all their minor league affiliates – the Tampa Bay Rays activated Kiermaier to both the 40- and 25-man rosters for the first time on September 30, 2013. He made his major league debut in that evening’s wild card tie-breaker game – the Rays’ 163rd game of the season – and played one inning against the Texas Rangers in the ninth as a defensive replacement. Rays general manager Andrew Friedman commented that the club included Kiermaier on the major league roster late that season specifically for his defense in center field. He played two innings in the 2013 American League Wild Card Game against the Cleveland Indians, which was his only postseason appearance that year. That winter, Baseball America rated him the tenth-best prospect in the Rays’ minor league system.</p><p align=justify>He was born and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana to parents Chris and Jim.

He hit a fly ball which appeared to be clearing the center field fence for a home run. Kiermaier leapt and momentarily perched himself upright on the top of the fence and waited to catch the ball before it landed. However, it dropped approximately 30 feet (9.1&nbsp;m) in front of the fence, and Kiermaier watched it bounce as he continued to cling to the fence. The ball had deflected off one of the catwalks suspended from the roof, and, in accordance with park rules, the umpires awarded a home run to Morales. One of 15 MLB outfielders to register a throw back into the infield at or above 100 miles per hour (160&nbsp;km/h) in 2015, Kiermaier led all MLB outfielders by reaching 100 MPH nine times, while all others combined to reach that speed 27 times.</p><p>Kiermaier was part of amateur championship teams at both the high and college levels. His high school won a state championship in Indiana, and a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) national championship at Parkland College, where he was twice named an NJCAA All-American. Kiermaier has gained attention for his overall outfield defense, strong throwing arm, and prowess for frequently robbing home runs. As a result, he has won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards for center fielders in 2015, 2016, and 2019.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kevin Kiermaier height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Kevin <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On May 18, 2014, Kiermaier hit his first major league home run against Mike Morin of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.
