He first rose to prominence in 2006, when his song “Dig Dug (Shake It)” became popular in his hometown. Wale became locally recognized and continued recording music for the regional audience. Producer Mark Ronson discovered Wale in 2006 and signed him to Allido Records in 2007. While signed to that label, Wale released several mixtapes and appeared in national media including MTV and various Black-American-focused magazines. A song called “Ridin’ in That Black Joint” was featured in the popular video game Saints Row 2′ s soundtrack in 2008.</p><p>In an interview with Flavorwire, Wale said that he incorporates elements of go-go in his music. Cyril Cordor of AllMusic described go-go as “a more raw, percussion-driven offshoot of disco” that originated in the Washington, D. C. area. Wale’s early singles that were played primarily in his local metropolitan area heavily sampled 1990s go-go records. Reviewing Attention Deficit, David Jeffries of allmusic remarked that Wale had a “post-Kanye, post-Lil Wayne, alternative-meets-hardcore style” and commented that Wale’s single “Chillin'”, which featured Lady Gaga, “crafts an instant floor-filler out of a sample from the 1969 hit ‘Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye'”.</p><p align=justify>Akinnagbe’s cousin&nbsp;His cousin is <a href=#>Gbenga Akinnagbe</a>, an actor who starred in The Wire.&nbsp;actor who was as a character in The Wire.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wale</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wale</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Zyla Moon Oluwakemi</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Wale ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Wale said that the television show Seinfeld inspired The Mixtape About Nothing: “the TV show’s ‘honest dialogue’ mirrors his lyrical style, which frequently references pop culture and politics while avoiding gangster-rap bluster”. After signing with Interscope, Wale began recording tracks for his major label debut: in a 2008 interview with Express, a newspaper published by the Washington Post Company, Wale announced that he was recording a song with Chrisette Michele called “Shades”, which discusses inter-black racism. Wale also appeared on Interscope label mate DJ Greg Street’s single “Dope Boys” which samples Hip Hop classic T.R.O.Y. alongside Lupe Fiasco and Kardinal Offishall.

Wale attended Robert Morris University and Virginia State University on football scholarships, then transferred to Bowie State University. However, he dropped out due to academic reasons. Wale’s love of the game of football and the Washington Redskins has led to a longstanding rumor that Wale had a tattoo of tight end Chris Cooley. He’s also the cousin of an actor Gbenga Akinnagbe, who is best known as for playing Chris Partlow on HBO’s The Wire. Wale’s first recorded track, called “Rhyme of the Century”, became his first song to ever be played on the local radio. In 2006, he was featured in the “Unsigned Hype” column of The Source magazine, and later signed to a local label, Studio 43. The track, called “Dig Dug (Shake It)” became popular in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia, and was a tribute to Ronald “Dig Dug” Dixon, who was a percussion player for the go-go band Northeast Groovers.

Cole and Bun B. The mixtape received positive reviews from Vibe magazine and website Pitchfork Media, but Colin McGowan of Cokemachineglow commented that it represented neither “a step forward or back [for the artist] so much as shouting-in-place. ” Wale did a guest performance on “Change”, a song by the Australian singer-songwriter Daniel Merriweather. It was written by Merriweather and Andrew Wyatt and produced by Mark Ronson. It was released on January 30, 2009, in the United States and Canada, and February 2, 2009, in the UK (where the song peaked at no.8). The song is included on Merriweather’s album Love & War.
