Singer, guitarist, entrepreneur and co-founder of the rock groups Blink-182, Box Car Racer, and Angels & Airwaves.&nbsp;He made platinum by releasing Blink-182 as the number one albums , which featured popular songs such as “Adam’s Song” and “All the Small Things.”</p><p>Angels and Airwaves guitarist&nbsp;Angels and Airwaves guitarist <a href=#>David Kennedy</a> was also the guitarist in his earlier band Box Car Racer.&nbsp;was also the guitarist for his former group Box Car Racer.</p><p>DeLonge grew to prominence playing pop punk music. Southern California had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an avid surfing, skating and snowboarding scene. In contrast to East Coast punk music, the West Coast wave of groups, Blink included, typically introduced more melodic aspects to their music. “New York is gloomy, dark and cold. It makes different music. The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,” said DeLonge. In a 2011 article, he outlined six musical acts that impacted his growth as a musician, among them Stiff Little Fingers, U2, Depeche Mode, New Order, Fugazi, and the Descendents. The last was his main influence when he began playing guitar; early recordings such as Buddha were an attempt to emulate their sound. Following the Descendents, DeLonge once cited Screeching Weasel as the second biggest influence on his songwriting in his early career.</p><p>DeLonge grew up in the suburbs of Poway, California, where he embraced skateboarding at an early age. When DeLonge received his first guitar, he began writing punk rock songs. He formed Blink-182 with bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor during his high school years. The band created a following in the mid-1990s through independent releases and relentless touring, particularly in their home country and in Australia. They signed to MCA Records in 1996 and their second album, Dude Ranch (1997), featured the hit single “Dammit”. The group had bigger success with Enema of the State (1999), which featured three hit singles and went quadruple-platinum in the U.S., selling upwards of 15 million copies worldwide. Blink-182 scored a number one album with 2001’s Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. DeLonge experimented with post-hardcore music on Box Car Racer, which formed into a full-fledged band in 2002, but dissolved the following year. Blink’s untitled fifth studio album (2003) reflected a change in tone within the group, which broke up in 2005 following internal tension, spearheaded by DeLonge.</p><p align=justify>He got married to Jennifer Jenkins in 2001.&nbsp;Jennifer and Jennifer have one daughter named&nbsp;He married Jennifer Jenkins in 2001.

By March 1996, the trio began to accumulate a genuine buzz among major labels, resulting in a bidding war between Interscope, MCA and Epitaph. MCA promised the group complete artistic freedom and eventually signed the band, but Raynor held a great affinity for Epitaph and began to feel half-invested in the band when they passed over the label. Their second effort, Dude Ranch, hit stores the following summer and the band headed out on their first Warped Tour. When lead single “Dammit” began rotation at Los Angeles-based KROQ-FM, other stations took notice and the single was added to rock radio playlists across the country. Dude Ranch shipped gold by 1998, but the exhaustive touring schedule brought tensions among the trio. Raynor had been drinking heavily to offset personal issues, and he was fired by DeLonge and Hoppus in mid-1998 despite agreeing to attend rehab and quit drinking. Travis Barker, drummer for tourmate The Aquabats, filled in for Raynor, learning the 20-song setlist in 45 minutes before the first show. Barker joined the band full-time in summer 1998 and the band entered the studio with producer Jerry Finn later that year to begin work on their third album.</p><h2>Tom DeLonge Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tom DeLonge is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United States.

He was removed from Poway High School in the second half of his junior year for going to a basketball game while inebriated. He was forced to attend a different school for one semester, nearby Rancho Bernardo High School, where he became friends with Kerry Key, and his girlfriend Anne Hoppus. Rancho Bernardo organized Battle of the Bands competitions, and DeLonge signed up, performing an original song titled “Who’s Gonna Shave Your Back Tonight?” to a packed auditorium. Drummer Scott Raynor was at the competition with his own group, which soon dissolved, after which he was introduced by friend Paul Scott to DeLonge at a party. The two began to organize jam sessions at Raynor’s home, shifting through various bassists. The following summer, DeLonge’s desire to be in a legitimate band increased significantly – Hoppus characterized his passion as “incessant whining and complaining”. Her brother, bassist Mark Hoppus, was new to San Diego and she introduced the two one night that August. The two would jam for hours in DeLonge’s garage, exchanging lyrics and writing new songs.</p><p align=justify>With the release of Enema of the State in June 1999, Blink-182 was catapulted to stardom. Three singles were released from the record—”What’s My Age Again?”, “All the Small Things”, and “Adam’s Song”—that became hit singles and MTV staples. “All the Small Things” became a number-one hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, but also became a crossover hit and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Although the band were criticized as synthesized, manufactured pop only remotely resembling punk and pigeonholed as a joke act due to the puerile slant of its singles and associating music videos, Enema of the State was an enormous commercial success. The album has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and had a considerable effect on pop punk music, inspiring a “second wave” of the genre and numerous acolytes. After multi-platinum success, arena tours and cameo appearances (American Pie), the band recorded Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), which debuted at number 1 in the United States, Canada, and Germany. Hit singles “The Rock Show”, “Stay Together for the Kids” and “First Date” continued the band’s mainstream success worldwide, with MTV cementing their image as video stars.</p><h2>Who is Tom DeLonge Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tom DeLonge</strong> married to <strong>Jennifer Jenkins DeLonge </strong>.

You may help us to build the dating records for Tom DeLonge!<p>DeLonge’s early guitar tone was described as “clean to crisply overdriven.” During those years, he tended to use Fender Custom Shop Stratocasters (and still occasionally uses in studio recordings), and his own Fender Tom DeLonge Stratocaster, with Seymour Duncan Invader pickups, Ernie Ball strings, Dunlop tortex picks, and a Whirlwind Selector A/B/Y box. The Mesa/Boogie Triple Rectifier was key to DeLonge’s early sound; he employed them to create a distorted sound. “A Mesa/Boogie is like a nuke: you plug it in and it fills up every piece of the sonic spectrum,” he said. As his sound gradually grew cleaner, he grew away from the Mesa/Boogies. DeLonge employed the Marshall JCM900 amps for his work on Dude Ranch, in which he improved his guitar tone. In a September 1999 Guitar Player article, DeLonge outlined his intentions: “I’m the kind of guitarist that wants the biggest, fattest, loudest, sound he can get.” As such, he refrained from toying with his guitar equipment for several years. “I was just into punk-rock. I thought we were cooler than every other band. I thought punk was way cooler and we knew something other people didn’t know. Now I look and think, ‘Fuck, there was a lot I didn’t know!'” he later remarked.</p><h2>Top Facts about Tom DeLonge</h2><li>Tom DeLonge is a founding member of Blink-182.</li><li>He left the band in 2015 to focus on other projects.</li><li>DeLonge has released music with Angels & Airwaves and Box Car Racer.</li><li>He is also an author, filmmaker, and entrepreneur.</li><li>In 2017, he founded To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science.</li><li>DeLonge has been interested in UFOs and extraterrestrial life for years.</li><li>He claims to have had personal experiences with UFO sightings.</li><li>DeLonge has written several books about his research into UFOs.</li><li>His work with To The Stars Academy aims to advance scientific understanding of these phenomena.</li><li>DeLonge was born on December 13, 1975 in Poway, California.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Tom Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rock Singer</strong>.
