American powerlifter who was featured in the 2008 film Bigger, Stronger, Faster, which took an objective use at steroid use and was directed by his brother Chris. He founded POWER Magazine and Super Training Gym and invented a weightlifting accessory called the Sling Shot.</p><p>He and <a href=#>Peter Kirkbride</a> are both accomplished powerlifters.</p><p>LFO were performing at the Warehouse, a club in Leeds, when Steve Beckett and Rob Mitchell arrived and noticed the positive reception club goers had to the track “LFO”. Beckett and Mitchell were the original creators of the Warp record label, but had not officially created the label yet. Despite this, Beckett and Mitchell offered to put out a 12-inch single, which was expected to sell about 2,000 copies but eventually became a Top 20 hit. The label released their first studio album Frequencies in 1991. Following the album’s release, Bell continued to release singles for other independent labels such as Carl Craig’s Planet E.</p><p>While working on a follow-up album, Bell began his partnership with Björk before the release of her album Post. Bell gave her a cassette of LFO demo material allowing her to use what she wanted for a future release. Björk chose a track that would later become her song “I Go Humble”, which would show up again in instrumental form as “Shove Piggy Shove” on the LFO album Advance in 1996. When asked about the long gap between records, Bell stated “It’s not intentional…It’s easy doing your first album as you have all the first part of your life to express. The second one is harder unless you’re going to repeat yourself… and repetition bores me a bit, it’s a complete wasted opportunity to be creative.” After the release of Advance, Bell and Varley parted ways, with Bell retaining rights to the name LFO. Bell continued to perform under the LFO moniker.</p><p align=justify>He and his wife Andee have two children. His brother Chris is also a powerlifter, as was his late brother Mike. He was born to Rosemary and Sheldon Bell.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark Bell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Weight Lifter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1976</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sacramento</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mark Bell ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
