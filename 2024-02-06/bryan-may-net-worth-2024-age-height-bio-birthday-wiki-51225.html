In the mid-1970s he used six of them, with an Echoplex delay (with extended delay time) plugged into a separate amplifier, and a second Echoplex plugged into yet another amp; he used a homemade booster, his only effects pedal, which was on all the time. His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.</p><p align=justify>May also cites Rory Gallagher as a major influence, saying “He was a magician. He was one of the very few people of that time who could make his guitar do anything, it seemed. I remember looking at that battered Stratocaster and thinking, ‘How does that (sound) come out of there?'” According to May, “…it was Rory that gave me my sound, and that’s the sound I still have.” May was also influenced by Steve Hackett, guitarist of the progressive rock band Genesis, in particular his harmony guitar solo at the end of the band’s epic 1971 song “The Musical Box”. Hackett said of May, “Equally, his energetic approach to guitar inspired me.”</p><h2>Who is Bryan May Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Bryan May</strong> married to <strong>Anita Dobson , Chrissie Mullen </strong>.
