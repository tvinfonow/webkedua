Who is Henry Tang dating now & how much money does Henry Tang have?</p><h2>Henry Tang Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Henry Tang</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Politician</strong> who was born on <strong>September 6, 1952</strong> in Happy Valley, <strong>Hong Kong</strong>. Born 6 September 1952, Tang was at Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital, Happy Valley, Wan Chai in British Hong Kong. His family worked in the textile industry. He came from Jiangsu, Wuxi to Hong Kong in 1949 in order to escape the communists taking control of the Chinese mainland.&nbsp;Henry Tang was born in British Hong Kong in 1952.&nbsp;After attending Culford School in Suffolk, England, Tang attended Cranbrook Schools in Bloomfield Hills and graduated from there.&nbsp;The University of Michigan awarded him a Bachelor of Arts degree.&nbsp;He graduated from the class of 1975.</p><p>He was the Chairman of Federation of Hong Kong Industries from 1995 to 2001.&nbsp;He was also a Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Committee Member and Steward of Hong Kong Jockey Club.&nbsp;Before joining the government, he was the Chairman of the Provisional Construction Industry Co-ordination Board.</p><p>Tang was involved in the Harbour Fest controversy as Chairman of the Economic Relaunch Strategy Group responsible for pushing ahead with the plan to spend $100 million to revive the economy after SARS, and said that he should be held responsible. Tang had said that although Mike Rowse, a senior civil servant, had actually signed the contract, Rowse as such was not required to be held politically responsible. However, during a Working Group meeting on 31 October 2003 and during an independent inquiry in May 2004, Tang allegedly said Rowse had not acted improperly and that there had been no irregularity in the implementation of the event. Tang had also said that all parties had underestimated the complexity of the event and may have been too ambitious in organising it in such a short timespan. He later withdrew the remark: just before a government inquiry opened on November 2004, Tang requested the ERWG minutes be deleted. Internal governmental disciplinary process fined Rowse for misconduct, but a High Court judge quashed the government ruling on 4 July 2008. Political commentator Frank Ching pointed to the huge credibility gap of the government. He noted that Tang’s attempt to shift political responsibility from himself, as the minister responsible, to a senior civil servant, was a travesty of justice for Rowse, and went against the Accountability System.</p><p>Tang took up his commerce post in July 2002 as part of a line-up of new secretaries aimed at improving the government’s transparency. He was promoted from Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology to Finance Secretary on 4 August 2003 replacing Antony Leung. Leung resigned on 16 July 2003 due to allegations of tax evasion in regards to his new car. Tang briefly served (25 May to 21 June 2005) as acting Chief Executive after Tung Chee Hwa, the former Chief Executive who resigned citing health reasons.</p><p align=justify>Tang was awarded the Young Industrialist of Hong Kong award 1989 and was named Global Leader of Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum 1993.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Henry Tang</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Henry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tang</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Happy Valley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hong Kong</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tom Tang Chung-yen</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kwok chin</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>William Tang</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Henry Tang ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
