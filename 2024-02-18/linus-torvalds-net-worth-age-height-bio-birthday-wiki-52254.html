He was a software engineer and the chief architect of the Linux kernel, which is a free and open-source software.&nbsp;He was also responsible for Subsurface and Git.</p><p>He is a software developer, like&nbsp;He is a software developer like <a href=#>Brian Behlendorf</a>..</p><p>Linus Benedict Torvalds (/ˈ l iː n ə s ˈ t ɔːr v ɔː l d z / LEE -nəs TOR -vawldz, Finland Swedish:&nbsp;[ˈliːnʉs ˈtuːrvɑlds] ( listen ) ; born 28 December 1969) is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and, historically, the principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for Linux operating systems (distributions) and other operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed version control system Git and the scuba dive logging and planning software Subsurface.</p><p>Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki between 1988 and 1996, graduating with a master’s degree in computer science from the NODES research group. His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the Finnish Army Uusimaa brigade, in the summer of 1989, selecting the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the mandatory military service of Finland. In the army he held the rank of Second Lieutenant, with the role of an artillery observer. Torvalds bought computer science professor Andrew Tanenbaum’s book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, in which Tanenbaum describes MINIX, an educational stripped-down version of Unix. In 1990, he resumed his university studies, and was exposed to UNIX for the first time, in the form of a DEC MicroVAX running ULTRIX. His MSc thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.</p><p align=justify>He was married to Tove Torvalds, a six-time Finnish national karate champion.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Linus Torvalds</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Linus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Torvalds</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Engineer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Helsinki</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Uusimaa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Finland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tove Torvalds</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Daniela Yolanda Torvalds, Patricia Miranda Torvalds, Celeste Amanda Torvalds</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Linus Torvalds ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He did not make use of assembly language. After the VIC-20 he purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. “Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland, Linus wrote his own assembler and editor (in addition to Pac-Man graphics libraries)” for the QL, as well as a few games. He wrote a Pac-Man clone named Cool Man. On 5 January 1991 he purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC before receiving his MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux.</p><h2>Linus Torvalds Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Linus Torvalds is one of the <strong>richest Engineer</strong> from Finland.
