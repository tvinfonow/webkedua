During a press conference following his team’s victory over the Texas Tech Red Raiders, Gundy criticized an article by Jenni Carlson of The Oklahoman. The article contained guesses as to why quarterback Bobby Reid, who had been publicly supported by the coaching staff earlier in the year, was demoted to second-string. Gundy condemned the article as a personal attack on a young player and offered himself as a better target for criticism when he shouted “Come after me! I’m a man! I’m forty!” Gundy has stated that he does not mind criticizing college athletes’ on-field performance but does not appreciate critiquing college athletes otherwise. The Oklahoman sports editor, Mike Sherman, stood by the story. Mike Griffith, president of the Football Writers Association of America, called Gundy’s behavior “completely inappropriate.” CBS Sportsline’s Dennis Dodd went further saying, “Mike Gundy needs to be reprimanded, definitely suspended, probably fined and maybe fired.” OSU athletic director Mike Holder stood behind Gundy, saying that “nothing is more important to us than our student-athletes.” Gundy would later state that the incident was a blessing in disguise, as the image of his strident defense of one of his players had a lasting positive effect on recruiting.</p><h2>Who is Mike Gundy Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mike Gundy</strong> married to <strong>Kristen Gundy</strong>.
