Relations between the two became so strained that at one point, the Red Wings seriously considered trading him to the Ottawa Senators. However, Yzerman gradually became a better defender and is now considered one of the best two-way forwards in the history of the game.</p><h2>Who is Steve Yzerman Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Steve Yzerman</strong> married to <strong>Lisa Brennan </strong>.
