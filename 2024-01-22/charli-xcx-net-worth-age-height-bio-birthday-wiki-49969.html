In an interview with The Guardian, Charli XCX said: “I was still in school, I’d just come out of this weird rave scene, and I wasn’t really sure what to make of that. And when I got signed I hated pop music; I wanted to make bad rap music. I didn’t know who I was. I didn’t know what I liked. Even though I was signed, I was still figuring it out.” She eventually flew out to Los Angeles to meet producers, and found it “wasn’t working out for me” until she met with American producer Ariel Rechtshaid.

This caught the attention of a promoter running numerous illegal warehouse raves and parties in east London, who invited her to perform. She was billed on flyers under the stage name Charli XCX, which was her MSN Messenger display name when she was younger. Despite the illicit nature of the gigs, her parents were supportive of her career and attended several raves with her. In late 2008, while 14 was never commercially released, she released the two singles “!Franchesckaar!” and double A-side “Emelline”/”Art Bitch”, under Orgy Music. She has since frequently expressed her distaste for her music of the time, going as far to call it “gimmicky dance tracks” and “fucking terrible Myspace music”.

So I feel like nothing is definite – like, I feel very all-over-the-place at the moment. But at the moment, my heart’s set on going to France and recording it, but that was different two months ago, so who knows what’s going to happen?” Frustrated with the music industry, she ended up going to Sweden, isolating herself from her record label, and made a punk-inspired album over a month. Working on the album with Patrik Berger, they made it at a fast pace, saying that it is “not thought-about, everything really spontaneous […] We don’t think — it’s like the first thing that comes out of my mouth is the cut on the record,” however it was eventually scrapped for a more “pop”-oriented album. The album included a song called “Mow That Lawn”, which was debuted live a year later at Ilosaarirock Festival in Finland.</p><h2>Who is Charli XCX Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Charli XCX</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

In an interview with DIY magazine, she stated that she wrote the record for girls and wants them to feel “a sense of empowerment”. Charli explained in her tour diary with Replay Laserblast that the record’s genre is still pop, but has “a very shouty, girl-power, girl-gang, Bow Wow Wow” feel to it at the same time.
