Because of his last name and reputation as a strong hitter, Berkman gained distinction as one of the Astros’ “Killer B’s” early in his career, which included Bagwell and Craig Biggio, two formidable veteran players who helped established the club as perennial playoff contenders in the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, journalist Dayn Perry jocosely noted in 1999 that the Astros, “in pursuit of arcane history, used eight players whose last names began with ‘B.'” The eight included Bagwell, Paul Bako, Glen Barker, Derek Bell, Sean Berry, Berkman, Biggio, and Tim Bogar.
