When the Canadian real estate market collapsed in 2008, Scott saw an opportunity to buy cheap properties in the U.S., where the recession was further along. Convincing JD to come with them, Scott and his wife left for Las Vegas that December, making their home in the nearby suburb of Summerlin, Nevada. Scott opened a third branch of Scott Real Estate and, considering the depressed market, switched to leasing properties, but for only 80 percent of the market rates to help renters who were recovering from the ongoing recession. At the same time, the move to Las Vegas put him in proximity to live venues and opportunities to perform magic. He began to explore ways to revive his career as an illusionist, at least part-time.</p><h2>Jonathan Scott Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jonathan Scott is one of the <strong>richest Tv Show Host</strong> from Canada. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jonathan Scott</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He began appearing on local stage productions around the seven years old.</p><p align=justify>He has been a host for the four previous Annual Leo Awards and was the host of the 2009 awards ceremony.</p><p align=justify>John Ian Scott was born on 28 April 1978, four minutes before his identical twin brother Drew, in Vancouver, British Columbia. He has an older brother, JD, and is the second son of Jim and Joanne Scott. Jim had fostered dreams of being a cowboy as he had seen on television, and so emigrated from Scotland to Canada as a teenager. He began working in the film industry as an actor, stuntman, and assistant director until the late 1970s. It was around that time when he decided to focus on raising his family, and they moved to a horse farm in the nearby town of Maple Ridge, British Columbia. James worked as a youth counselor, and Joanne continued her career as a paralegal in downtown Vancouver. On their seventh birthday, their father encouraged the twins to get a job. They looked through the help wanted ads, but ultimately started a business with their mother called JAM (for Jon, Andrew, and Mom) making nylon-wrapped clothes hangers. In interviews, they have related how they would sell them door to door, eventually selling thousands to a woman who sold American paraphernalia in Japan.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Show Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2010, Dividian Production Group became Scott Brothers Entertainment, and the brothers expanded it into a TV, film, and digital production company with offices in the U.S. and Canada. The success of Property Brothers spawned several spinoffs, including Buying and Selling (2012 – present) and Brother vs. Brother (2013 – present). By 2014, the shows’ combined viewership was more than 26 million. As their filming schedule grew, they stopped accepting private clients. The franchise has since expanded to include other one-off series like Brothers Take New Orleans and the 2016 web series In the Scott Seat.</p><p>The boys’ continued job search led them to an ad recruiting child clowns to perform in parades. After completing classes with the local parks and recreation department, they were hired at C$10 a gig, eventually making as much as $100 per hour. John, however, grew tired of making himself up, and began to transition as a performer. As a child, he’d seen a magic show on New Year’s Eve that inspired him, and by the age of ten, he was making his own magic props; by 15 he was using a barn as a workshop to create large-scale illusions. He studied the definitive volumes of Tarbell Course in Magic, and sought out professional illusionists David Wilson and Shawn Farquhar, who became mentors and friends. He joined the Vancouver Magic Circle and the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and over the next decade he won several awards, including 3rd Best Stage Performer of the Pacific Coast Association of Magicians at 16.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jonathan Scott height</b> <strong>6 ft 5 in</strong> Jonathan <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 5 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After several negative experiences with real-estate brokers, Drew enrolled in a real estate program in 2004 to obtain a license. Scott obtained his license soon after. That same year, the twins founded Scott Real Estate Inc., a company to provide clients with a “one stop shop” for services in the buying, selling, and renovating of homes, as well as in design consulting and staging open houses. In January 2006, however, Drew moved to Vancouver and gave himself a year to pursue his acting career in earnest. As the year came to a close, he took out a license in Vancouver, and opened a Scott Real Estate branch there. Scott remained in Calgary to run the business along, sometimes working as many as 18 hours a day. He married his fiancée on 7 July 2007.</p><p align=justify>The twins have become sex symbols.
