As a toddler, in 1980, he attended Leesville Baptist Church every week. According to his book, Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life, he was involved in Bible school, choir, and the youth group. The book made The New York Times Best Seller List in 2004, debuting at number two. It was written with Allison Glock and published by Random House. Barely mentioning American Idol, Aiken instead turned his focus to the people who had the most influence in his life – his mother, grandparents, siblings, teachers, and friends – and to the importance of religion in his life. He describes himself as a proud Southern Baptist who journeyed away from those roots in his late teens in search of a religion with more liberal social policies. He then returned to that church because of family and social ties although he remains at odds with the church on some issues.</p><p>Aiken started at an early age to believe in a life of service. In 1995, Clay started working at the YMCA.

While noted for his performance of ballads, such as Neil Sedaka’s “Solitaire”, his upbeat performances, including The Foundations’ “Build Me Up Buttercup”, were also appreciated. Aiken received enough votes every week to keep him out of the bottom three. Part of his appeal was his “geek to chic” transformation in appearance. “I looked like Opie”, Aiken said to People magazine regarding his appearance at his American Idol audition in 2002. He replaced his glasses with contact lenses and agreed to let the show’s stylists change his hair style. With longer, flat ironed, spiky hair and a penchant for wearing striped shirts, Aiken had established a trademark look by the final American Idol season 2 show.</p><h2>Clay Aiken Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Clay Aiken is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States.

In 1995, Clay started working at the YMCA. Still in high school, Clay learned quickly that he could make a difference in the lives of young people. He found his interest in special education while directing YMCA children’s camps as a teenager, and at age 19, he served as a substitute teacher for a classroom of autistic students at Brentwood Elementary School in Raleigh. It was during that experience that he decided to finish college and become a special education teacher. While attending college in Charlotte, he took a part-time job as an assistant to a boy with autism, and it was this child’s mother, Diane Bubel, who urged him to audition for American Idol. Although his American Idol activities temporarily delayed his academic pursuits, Aiken completed his course work while on tour and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in special education in December 2003.</p><p align=justify>On October 14, 2003, Aiken released his first solo album, Measure of a Man, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with 613,000 copies sold in its first week, the highest-selling debut for a solo artist in 10 years. The album received RIAA Double Platinum certification on November 17, 2003 (a Double Platinum plaque was presented to Aiken by Clive Davis on October 22, 2003, during Good Morning America). The album spawned both the hit single “Invisible” and his first hit song, “This Is the Night” (both co-written by British songwriter Chris Braide). Later that year, Aiken won the Fan’s Choice Award at the American Music Awards ceremony, and his CD single “This Is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water” won the Billboard award for the Best-Selling Single of 2003.</p><h2>Who is Clay Aiken Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Clay Aiken</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
