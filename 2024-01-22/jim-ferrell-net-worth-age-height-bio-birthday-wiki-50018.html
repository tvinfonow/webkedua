After being a member of the Republican Party for twenty years, in 2012 he switched to the Democratic Party. Ferrell previously served ten years on the Federal Way City Council and was the prime mover behind the city’s transition from a Council–Manager form of city government to a Mayor-Council or “Strong Mayor” government. Federal Way is currently the 9th largest city in the state of Washington.</p><p>Jim Ferrell grew up in Federal Way until the age of nine when his father died. After his father’s passing, he, his mother, his twin brother and his older brother and sister moved to Yelm, Washington. Jim Ferrell graduated from Yelm High School in 1985 as a multi-sport athlete and student body president. After high school, Ferrell attended the University of Washington and walked on, as an outside linebacker, to the Washington Huskies football team, then led by Hall of Fame head coach Don James. Ferrell spent four seasons (1985–88) on the team, receiving the 1986 Brian Stapp Memorial Award for the most inspirational non-letterman, earning the 1988 Bob Jarvis Award for most inspirational walk-on player, and was chosen by his fellow players in 1988 to win the prestigious Guy Flaherty Medal for the team’s most inspirational player, despite being primarily a scout team player for all four seasons. After graduating in 1989 from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in political science, Ferrell attended the Gonzaga University School of Law and graduated with a Juris Doctor degree (J.D.) in 1993.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jim Ferrell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sviatoslav</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Belonogov</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jim Ferrell ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>One of Ferrell’s prime initiatives while on the city council was a successful transition to making Federal Way Municipal Court judges elected, instead of appointed. Analogous to this interest in having public accountability for officials, Jim Ferrell supported the February 2008 ballot initiative to transition from a Council–Manager form of city government to a Mayor-Council or “Strong Mayor” government. The initiative failed by about 10 percentage points. The following year, Ferrell spearheaded a second effort to make the same transition in city government. This initiative, on its second attempt, passed by about 3 percentage points on the 2009 General Election ballot.</p><h2>Jim Ferrell Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jim Ferrell is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jim Ferrell</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>While in law school, Ferrell was a White House intern during the presidency of George H. W. Bush and worked as a legislative assistant for State Senators Pete von Reichbauer and Ray Schow; both of whom represented Washington’s 30th legislative district, which includes the entirety of Federal Way. During this period, Jim Ferrell was nearly appointed to the Washington State Senate, finishing second behind Schow to fill the seat left vacant after von Reichbauer’s election to the King County Council.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In April 2012, five months following Ferrell’s election to a third term to the Federal City Council, he announced that he would be switching parties; from the Republican party to the Democratic party. In his column explaining his decision, Ferrell said it was motivated by what he saw as a move by the Republican party to more far-right tone and reactionary policies. Chief among his concerns were that the Republican party appeared to him to take neither global climate change nor a 21st-century approach to energy policy seriously. Also concerning Ferrell was what he saw as the Republican party’s continued preference toward tax cuts for the rich instead of policies to mitigate the jobs lost and lives upended following the Great Recession of 2008.</p><p>On May 6, 2013, Jim Ferrell announced his candidacy for Federal Way’s mayor in the 2013 election, in what turned out to be a rematch of the 2010 contest between himself and (then) Mayor Skip Priest. In addition to similar themes heard during the 2010 election, Ferrell was also critical of Priest’s cuts in the city’s workforce, particularly its police force, during his term in office, as well as his advocacy for legislation that would have dismantled Sound Transit. Public safety was of particular interest during the election due to the 2013 mass shooting at Federal Way’s Pinewood Village apartment complex that left five dead, in addition to a 24% increase in burglaries and a 12% increase in auto thefts in the city in 2012. The rematch of the 2010 election resulted in the unseating of the incumbent mayor with Ferrell prevailing with more than 55% of the vote.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jim Ferrell height</b> Not available right now.

Miloscia ended up winning the election by more than 11 percentage points. The following year, Ferrell took on incumbent Federal Way City Councilmember Mary Gates, who had been a city councilmember since Federal Way was incorporated in 1990. Ultimately, Ferrell defeated Gates by nearly 5 percentage points. In his two subsequent city council reelection races in 2007 and 2011, Ferrell did not face any opposition.</p><p align=justify>Jim Ferrell took office as Federal Way’s second elected mayor on January 1, 2014.</p><h2>Who is Jim Ferrell Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jim Ferrell</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
