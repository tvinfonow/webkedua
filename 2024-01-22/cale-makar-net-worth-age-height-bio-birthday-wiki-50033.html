Cale Douglas Makar, a Canadian professional ice hockey defenseman, was born October 30, 1998. He currently plays for the Colorado Avalanche (NHL).&nbsp;The Avalanche selected him in the fourth round of the NHL Entry Draft 2017.</p><p>Makar returned to Calgary Flames to play at the minor-midget level. In his one full season in 2014-15, Makar was the team’s most valuable player with 23 points in 34 league matches. He was also named to the Alberta Midget Hockey League First All-Star Team.&nbsp;Makar was an affiliate player to Brooks Bandits, the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), in order to retain NCAA eligibility. He scored five points in three regular-season games.&nbsp;Makar, a third-ranked defenceman with seven points in 20 games, helped the Bandits reach finals.&nbsp;Having agreed to return with the Bandits in the forthcoming seasons, Makar announced his commitment to play collegiate hockey with the University of Massachusetts-Amherst of the Hockey East NCAA conference on August 29, 2015.</p><p>Makar was first selected by Hockey Canada to compete for Team Canada West at the World Junior A Challenge in 2015 and 2016.

His single goal came at a pivotal time on August 4, 2017, against Sweden, tying the game 4–4 in the third period.

As a freshman, he immediately assumed a top-pairing role, alongside Jake McLaughlin, and recorded his first collegiate point in his debut against Arizona State University on October 6, 2017. He recorded his first goal in a 4–0 victory over Merrimack College on October 27, 2017.</p><p align=justify>Makar, a 17-year-old defenseman, was a standout for the Bandits in 2015-16.
