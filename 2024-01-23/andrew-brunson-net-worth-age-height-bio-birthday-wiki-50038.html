Who is Andrew Brunson dating now & how much money does Andrew Brunson have?</p><h2>Andrew Brunson Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Andrew Brunson</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Pastor</strong> who was born on <strong>January 3, 1968</strong> in Black Mountain, Black Mountain, <strong>United States</strong>. Andrew Craig Brunson (born January 3, 1968) is an American-Hungarian pastor and a teaching elder of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. Brunson was arrested in Turkey, where he had lived since the mid-1990s, and in October 2016 during the purges occurring after the 2016 Turkish coup d’état attempt against Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (along with the arrests of tens of thousands of Turkish military personnel, civil servants, educators, academics, dissidents, and journalists). In 2019, Brunson published a memoir about his ordeal. Brunson is an evangelical pastor of the Izmir Resurrection Church, a small Protestant church with about 25 congregants. T-Online describes the church as having been held in a room in a tenement.</p><p>Brunson was held for over a year without charges. Turkish prosecutors charged Brunson with involvement in the failed July 2016 coup attempt. Turkish media reported that Brunson had been accused of espionage and attempting to overthrow the government. He was originally charged with having links to FETÖ and PKK (both are considered terrorist organizations by the Turkish state). The New York Times reported that two secret witnesses accused Brunson of “hosting Kurdish refugees in a guesthouse and holding services and gatherings sympathetic to the PKK”. Brunson denied helping the coup, and denied he had intentionally had contact with either group blamed for the coup. He was one of 20 American citizens who was prosecuted in connection with the post-coup purges.</p><p>On October 11, 2017, departing U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John R. Bass said Brunson “appears to be being held simply because he’s an American citizen who as a man of faith was in contact with a range of people in this country who he was trying to help, in keeping with his faith. And at a time when there were lots of interactions between many different people in society, and for some reason, some specific set of his interactions suddenly are being classified as support for terrorism, for membership in a terrorist organization. I have yet to see a consistent description of which specific terrorist organization he is supposed to be a member of. People don’t seem to have had a straight answer on that within the Turkish government. So for all those reasons, we believe he should be released. And U.S. government officials have continued to encourage the Turkish government to release him.”</p><p>Trump brought this issue up with Erdogan at a meeting on May 13, 2017. On September 28, 2017, Erdoğan said the United States should exchange Pennsylvania-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen with Pastor Andrew Brunson, saying “You have a pastor too. Give him to us…. Then we will try [Brunson] and give him to you.” The Federal judiciary alone determines extradition cases in the U.S. An August 2017 decree gave Erdogan authority to approve the exchange of detained or convicted foreigners with people held in other countries. Asked about the suggested swap on September 28, 2017, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: “I can’t imagine that we would go down that road…. We have received extradition requests for [Gülen].” Anonymous US officials have said to reporters that the Turkish government has not yet provided sufficient evidence for the U.S. Justice Department to charge Gülen.</p><p align=justify>A December 14, 2016, a Sabah daily news story, said to be based on an informant, claimed that Brunson, while dispensing aid among Syrian refugees, tried to divide Turkey with sermons praising Gülenism and by speaking in support of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The pro-Erdogan administration newspaper Takvim alleges that Brunson was a “high-level member of the Gülen movement” and an American spy, positioned to become CIA chief in Turkey had the 2016 coup attempt succeeded. Takvim’ s editor-in-chief, Ergun Diler, alleged that Brunson fended off an assassination attempt thanks to his intelligence agency training, further claiming that Brunson was influential all over the region. Diler speculated that the CIA would assassinate Brunson in prison if it thought he would not be deported back to the U.S.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrew Brunson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrew</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrew</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pastor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Black Mountain</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Black Mountain</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ron Brunson, Pam Brunson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Norine Brunson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jacqueline Furnari</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Andrew Brunson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

On the same day, President Trump released a tweet, stating that the United States would impose sanctions on Turkey due to Brunson’s detention. According to the Independent, Turkey moving Brunson to house arrest on July 25 was seen as “too little, too late” by American authorities and a phone call between the two countries on the 26th was described as “not going well”. It associates the July 25 swap with the release of a Turkish citizen by Israel on the 15th, as it is claimed that there was an offer for a swap between the two. On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on two top Turkish government officials who were involved in the detention of Brunson, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gül and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu.
