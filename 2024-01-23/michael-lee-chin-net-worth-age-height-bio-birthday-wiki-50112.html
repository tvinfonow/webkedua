Lee-Chin was the son of Hyacinth Gloria Chen and Aston Lee. He was born in Port Antonio in Jamaica in 1951.&nbsp;His parents were both biracial Africans and Chinese-Jamaican.&nbsp;His mother, Vincent Chen, married Lee-Chin when he was seven years old.&nbsp;Chen was a child of a previous relationship. The couple had seven more children together, six boys as well as one girl.&nbsp;Lee-Chin’s mother was a sales representative for Avon and worked as a bookkeeper at various local businesses. His stepfather owned a local grocery shop.</p><p>He went to Canada in 1970 on a scholarship sponsored by Jamaica to study Civil Engineering at McMaster University. He graduated in 1974.&nbsp;After his first year, he was able to pay for his tuition on his own.</p><p>Lee-Chin spent two years at the Investors Group, in the Hamilton, Ontario office and in 1979, moved to Regal Capital Planners and became regional manager. While at the company, in 1983, he secured a loan from the Continental Bank of Canada for C$500,000 to purchase a stake in Mackenzie Financial Group and formed Kicks Athletics with Andrew Gayle. By 1987, the investment was worth C$3.5 million.</p><p>Lee-Chin was reluctant to invest in the dotcom boom, and saw AIC investments lose 8 per cent in value, even as the S&P gained 56 per cent. Investors moved US$224 million out of AIC’s flagship “Advantage Mutual Fund”. The Globe and Mail ran an article predicting even more investors to leave the fund, meaning that they would run out of cash and be forced to sell its core holdings. Lee-Chin’s response was to sell stock in Coca-Cola, and invest US$65 million into Mackenzie Holdings (the same firm in which he had invested US$400,000 16 years previously). Letters were sent to all 350,000 investors, explaining the strategy. The investors were calmed by the purchase, and the stock was later sold to Investor Group (the same company Lee-Chin had worked for in the 1980s) at more than twice the price AIC had paid for it. In 2000 and 2001, following the dotcom crash, AIC outperformed the market with 26 per cent growth and 4 per cent decline respectively.</p><p align=justify>Lee-Chin’s initial job was as a member of the Frenchman’s Cove Hotel’s landscaping team in 1965.&nbsp;He was offered a job as a summer cleaner on the Jamaica Queen cruise vessel.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael Lee-Chin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lee-Chin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chairman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Port Antonio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Portland Parish</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Hyacinth Gloria Chen, Aston Lee</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Vera Lee-Chin</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Adrian Lee-Chin, Paul Lee-Chin, Elizabeth Lee-Chin, Maria Lee-Chin, Michael Lee-Chin Jr.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Michael Lee-Chin ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

At the time, the company had holdings of around C$800,000. He renamed the company AIC, and developed it to a fund that today controls around C$6 Billion, with hundreds of thousands of investors. Following the acquisition of AIC Limited, Lee-Chin set up the Berkshire group of companies – comprising an investment planning arm, a securities dealership and an insurance operation. By 2007, Berkshire amassed more than C$12 billion of assets under administration. In 2007, Manulife acquired Berkshire from Portland Holdings in exchange for shares, making Portland one of the largest shareholders of Manulife.</p><h2>Michael Lee-Chin Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Michael Lee-Chin is one of the <strong>richest Chairman</strong> from Jamaica. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Michael Lee-Chin</b>'s net worth <strong>1.6&nbsp;billion USD (2020)</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Michael Lee-Chin OJ, OOnt, a Jamaican-Canadian billionaire businessman and philanthropist, is the chairman and CEO at Portland Holdings Inc., a private investment company in Ontario, Canada.</p><p align=justify>Between 1962 and 1969, he attended Titchfield High High School.</p><p align=justify>In 1974, he married Vera Lee-Chin, a Ukrainian Canadian whom he had met at university. They parted in 1991, and officially separated (though did not divorce) in 1997. Ms. Lee-Chin has since contested the terms of the separation agreement, claiming that Lee-Chin did not disclose his actual wealth at the time of the separation. The couple had three children, Michael Jr., Paul, and Adrian.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1.6&nbsp;billion USD (2020)</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chairman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Similar to the experience of the late 1990s, Lee-Chin again has shied away from investing in commodities and the energy market boom. He has specifically stated that “We [AIC] do not like commodities-type businesses nor most high-tech companies simply because they are implicitly poor enterprises which we would not want to hold for the long term”.</p><p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Jamaica went through a period of financial crisis. Lee-Chin saw potential in his native country, and Portland purchased 75 per cent of the National Commercial Bank of Jamaica for 6 billion Jamaican dollars (US$127 million) from the Jamaican Government. In 2003, Senvia Money Services Inc., a global money transfer company, was established. This was followed in 2004, by the acquisition of AIC Financial Group Limited, headquartered in Trinidad.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michael Lee-Chin height</b> Not available right now.

It recovered throughout the early 1990s by maintaining investments in large groups, such as Merrill Lynch and TD bank (formerly Toronto Dominion). This caused investments to grow from US$8 million in 1990 to nearly US$8 billion by 1998.</p><p align=justify>In November 2003, AIC was part of a regulatory investigation involving 105 Canadian mutual funds companies. In its review of AIC, investigators found no evidence of late trading and market timing activity by AIC staff. However, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) did find that over the 1999-2003 period, AIC permitted specific third party investors to engage in market timing trades in AIC Funds that generated profits of $127 million. In the Settlement Agreement between AIC and the OSC, the OSC stated that “Accordingly, the conduct of AIC in failing to protect fully the best interests of the Relevant Funds in respect of the frequent trading market timing was contrary to the public interest.” As a result, in December 2004, AIC Limited was forced to return CAD $58.8 million to affected investors, which was the largest penalty imposed on any of the fund companies in the OSC investigation.</p><h2>Who is Michael Lee-Chin Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Michael Lee-Chin</strong> married to <strong>Vera Lee-Chin </strong>.
