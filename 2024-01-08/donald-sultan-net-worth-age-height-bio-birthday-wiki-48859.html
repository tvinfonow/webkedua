Sultan (born 1951) is an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker, particularly well-known for large-scale still life paintings and the use of industrial materials such as tar, enamel, spackle and vinyl tiles. He has been exhibiting internationally in prominent museums and galleries, and his works are included in important museum collections all over the globe. Sultan is the recipient of numerous honors and awards for his artistic achievements.</p><p>Sultan’s use of industrial materials in this way is striking and innovative, and Vivien Raynor has made this point in The New York Times stating that “Donald Sultan is descended from the Process artists of the late 1960s in that he makes art out of materials that are very much a part of contemporary life. Yet even as his coeval, Julian Schnabel, has cornered plates as a medium, Sultan seems to have been the first to work in tar, combining it with spackle and latex on a ground consisting of vinyl tiles attached to Masonite.” It is through the use of these industrial materials, as well as through the deconstruction of his subjects into basic forms, that Sultan’s paintings are enriching and elevating the still-life tradition. He is exploring the medium further through techniques of gouging, sanding, and buffing to create flatness, depth, gloss, and texture. The paintings are made of the same materials as the building in which the viewer stands; the architecture participates in the paintings. Weighty and structured, they are minimal and expressionist at the same time, while his images contradict their common association with fragility. “Sultan pushes the boundaries of painting as he virtually sculpts the painting into pictures that are minimal but opulently rich,” notes columnist R. Couri Hay, a former editor of Andy Warhol’s Interview Magazine in his 2011 profile of Sultan for the Hamptons Magazine. The process of making these painting, suggests The New York Times, is technically so complex and, consequently, so painstakingly slow, that finishing “a single painting can take up to a month, so that Mr. Sultan’s annual output is 12 to 18 paintings.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Donald Sultan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Donny</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hageman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Painter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Asheville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>North Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Terrie Sultan</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Penn Sultan</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Donald Sultan ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

His first solo exhibition was mounted in 1977 at Artists Space in New York, followed by group shows at Mary Boone Gallery in 1978 and Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1979. As Sultan’s work started to attract media attention and receive critical acclaim, prominent galleries and museums around the world such as the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1981, and the Houston Museum of Contemporary Art also in 1981, began to include his paintings in their exhibitions. In 1987 alone, impressive solo exhibitions were mounted at the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Blum Helman Gallery in New York. Reviewing these exhibitions for The New York Times, art critic Roberta Smith wrote, “Mr. Sultan is nothing if not a master of physical density, of the well-built image and the well-carpentered painting. He seems particularly to love the way an implacable slab of material can be made to flip-flop into a classically perfect, illusionistic form…”</p><h2>Donald Sultan Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Donald Sultan is one of the <strong>richest Painter</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Donald Sultan</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Donald Sultan was born in Asheville, North Carolina in 1951. Both of his parents were interested in the arts. His father was a tire company owner who painted abstract paintings as a hobby, and his mother, Phyllis actively pursued theatre. It was through his mother that Sultan developed an early interest in theatre. “I was acting and then I learned how to make theatrical sets and paint them,” he recalled, “I did apprenticeships in different professional theaters.” With his father’s encouragement, however, Sultan chose to pursue art professionally, and he earned a BFA degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1973 and an MFA from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1975. While still in school, Sultan grew dissatisfied with traditional methods of painting and began experimenting in technique, surface, and media, which eventually led him to use industrial tools and materials.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Painter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Donald Sultan was married once. His wife was also from Asheville, North Carolina, and they moved to New York together in 1975. The marriage ended in divorce. He has two children – a daughter and a son. Sultan spends time between his spacious loft in Tribeca, a historic 1760 house in Sag Harbor, Long Island, which he bought in 1984, and a Paris apartment on the fashionable Rue Marbeuf, just off the Champs Elysees.</p><p>After receiving an MFA degree from the Art Institute of Chicago, Donald Sultan moved to New York in 1975 to begin his career as an artist. At first he was supporting himself by helping other artists construct lofts during the day and painting at night. He soon got a full-time position as a handyman in an art gallery, a job that lasted until the gallery closed in 1978. In 1979, Sultan won a $2,500 Creative Artists Public Service Grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, and that money enabled him to work full-time on his art. “By then I had started to show at a couple of places and to sell enough work to keep going,” he said.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Donald Sultan height</b> Not available right now.

His silhouetted charcoal drawings on paper, as well as his compositions in color conte crayon and flock, often explore the forms of fruits and flowers, resulting in largely monochromatic and prominent images. His flowers float and cluster together, pushing the edges of the paper and creating images that are bold and at times appear erotic and surreal. “I have been using flower imagery for 40 years,” he says, “only because in the 1970s, I started to see the urban environment as a source for new growth. At the time, no one in my generation was painting flowers; now, of course, everyone is.”</p><p align=justify>Since 1982, Donald Sultan has been actively participating in various educational institutions’ Visiting Artist Programs.

He was represented by a prestigious gallery, some of his paintings were selling for more than $100,000 each.” These paintings, explains the British art historian and author Ian Dunlop, “fall into two groups: the first group consists of bold, brightly colored pictures with well-defined shapes and crisp outlines forming a clear silhouette; the second group consists of dark, hard to read pictures full of menace and often inspired by disastrous industrial events such as warehouse fires, airplane crashes, and freight train derailments. In both cases the pictures make a strong, immediate visual statement.”</p>You may read full biography about Donald Sultan from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfmbyvrcudZKytnKmur3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=/2024-01-08/dylan-cole-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48849.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dylan Cole Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a>
