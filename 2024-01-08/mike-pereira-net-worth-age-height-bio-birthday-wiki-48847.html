He began a column on FoxSports.com and started to provide commentary during Fox Sports football telecasts. During Week 1 of the 2010 NFL season, Pereira correctly predicted that referee Gene Steratore would rule what appeared to be a game-winning catch by Calvin Johnson as incomplete. “That was my first real time of being put on the spot”, Pereira would later say. “I was worried to death that the referee was going to say it’s a touchdown and I’d be out of a job in one week… It validated my role as to being able to go on and explain things so people could understand why a decision was made on the field. Then at that point on, I got more air time.” Pereira is also a frequent guest on KNBR during football season.</p><h2>Mike Pereira Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mike Pereira is one of the <strong>richest Football Official</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Mike Pereira</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Mike Pereira (born April 13, 1950) is a former American football official and later Vice President of Officiating for the National Football League (NFL).

His successor, Tony Corrente, retained Pereira on his staff as a consultant through the Pac-12’s 2011–12 football season.</p><p>In 2012, Sports Illustrated named Pereira as one of the NFL’s most indispensable broadcasting talents, saying, “Viewers have longed for broadcasters to provide accurate explanations from the NFL’s byzantine rule book, and Pereira, thankfully, has taken the burden off ex-jocks and announcers”. Michael Hiestand of USA Today wrote that “after Fox’s groundbreaking move to put the ex-NFL vice president of officiating on-air, Pereira proved to be a candid voice — not a shill for the almighty NFL”. However, Danny O’Neil of the Seattle Times wrote that “Pereira has assumed the role of the overzealous defense attorney … his appearances generally conclude with him concluding that the referees have gotten it right yet again … Analyst is the title that FOX hangs on Pereira, but advocate is more appropriate”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mike Pereira height</b> Not available right now.

Pereira retired from the NFL after the 2009 season.</p><p align=justify>Pereira also sparked coverage by others in the media when he criticized the commentary of Monday Night Football announcer Jon Gruden, calling him out as a “blowhard … who spouts off when he doesn’t know what he’s talking about”. Pereira specifically felt that Gruden “butchered” the analysis of two defenseless receiver plays during the telecast of an Atlanta Falcons-New Orleans Saints game. However, Doug Farrar of Yahoo! Sports thought that Pereira should have instead taken the higher road, and Fox should “lay down the law to Pereira [and] needs to be told to put the agendas away”.</p><h2>Who is Mike Pereira Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mike Pereira</strong> married to <strong>Gail Pereira</strong>.
