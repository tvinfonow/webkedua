Fortuna came in overweight so it was no longer a defense for Easter Jr. as he would’ve retained his belt even if Fortuna won the fight. Nonetheless Easter gave a shaky performance as the shorter southpaw Fortuna was able to trouble Easter with his hand-speed and movement, he was even able to rattle Easter multiple times throughout the fight. However Fortuna had a point deducted in the second round due to tactical misconduct. Even though Easter’s performance was underwhelming he was able to earn a very controversial split decision from the judges (114-113, 115-112, and 113-114) which resulted in an on pour of boos from the crowd.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Robert Easter Jr. height</b> <strong>5 ft 11 in</strong> Robert <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 11 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In his next fight, on September 9, 2016, Easter faced undefeated top contender Richard Commey of Ghana for the IBF lightweight title.

Commey was able to knock Easter down with a counter right hand in the eight round, albeit it was a controversial knockdown as Easter’s glove barely grazed the canvas. Easter was then able to subsequently stagger Commey in the ninth as he was hit was a massive shot by Easter when he was against the ropes. Easter then hurt Commey again severely in the twelfth and final round with a right hand, nearly knocking him down as Commey’s knees buckled and he had to hold on to survive.
