Nicknamed the “Man of Steal”, he is widely regarded as baseball’s greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner. He holds the major league records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the ten-time American League (AL) All-Star ranked among the sport’s top 100 all-time home run hitters and was its all-time leader in base on balls. In 2009, he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first ballot appearance.</p><p>Contrary to speculation, Henderson’s refusal to officially retire had not been delaying his eligibility for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period has been based on major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, “I believe today, and people say I’m crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them … they can always ring my phone and I’ll come on down and help their ballclub, that’s how much I love the game.”</p><p align=justify>He married Pam Henderson, and they had three children, Angela and Alexis.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ricky Henderson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ricky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Henderson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Athlete</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chicago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Pamela Palmer</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ricky Henderson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball. Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers. In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They have three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.</p><h2>Ricky Henderson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ricky Henderson is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Athlete</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Ricky Henderson</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was a football star at Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California.

He was named Rickey Nelson Henley, after singer-actor Ricky Nelson, and is the son of John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley. Henderson later joked, “I was already fast. I couldn’t wait.” When he was two years old, his father left home, and his family moved to Oakland, California, when he was seven. His father died in an automobile accident 10 years after leaving home. His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley’s junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname. As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower—a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers. In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so. Henderson later said, “All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that’s the way it was supposed to be done.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Athlete</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Henderson spent the 1978 season with the Jersey City A’s of the Eastern League.

In 1979, Henderson started the season with the Ogden A’s of the Pacific Coast League. In 71 games for Ogden, he had a batting average of .309 and stole 44 bases.</p><p>Henderson made his major league debut with Oakland on June 24, 1979, getting two hits in four at-bats, along with a stolen base. He batted .274 with 33 stolen bases in 89 games. In 1980, Henderson became the third modern-era player to steal 100 bases in a season (Maury Wills 104 in 1962 and Lou Brock’s 118 in 1974 had preceded him). His 100 steals broke Eddie Collins’ franchise record of 81 in 1910 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics and set a new American League (AL) record, surpassing Ty Cobb’s 96 set in 1915.

He spent the first season of his minor league career with the Boise A’s of the Northwest League. In 46 games, Henderson batted .336 and hit three home runs and two triples. Henderson spent the following season with the Modesto A’s. He batted .345 in 134 games during his record-setting season with Modesto. Henderson, along with Darrell Woodard, nearly broke the league record for team stolen bases. The Modesto A’s finished the season with 357 stolen bases, just shy of the league record of 370. While Woodard tied the single-season player record with 90 stolen bases, Henderson beat the record by stealing 95 bases, and was awarded the Sundial Trophy, given to the Modesto A’s Most Valuable Player.</p><p align=justify>Regarding Henderson’s 1982 season, the mid-’80s book The Hidden Game of Baseball looked at such statistics as .78 expected runs with a runner on first and no outs, 1.07 expected runs with runner on second and no outs, and only .25 expected runs no one on and one out. The authors concluded that with Henderson’s 130 stolen bases he contributed 22.2 runs to the A’s offense. But by being caught stealing 42 times, he cost his team 20.6 runs. And therefore, the authors concluded, the net effect of his running activity was merely 1.6 extra runs for the season. A later analysis determined his net contribution was 5.3 runs for the season.</p><h2>Who is Ricky Henderson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ricky Henderson</strong> married to <strong>Pamela Palmer </strong>.
