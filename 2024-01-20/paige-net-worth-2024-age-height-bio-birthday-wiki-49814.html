At Battleground, Paige lost a rematch for the Divas Championship to Lee. On the post-Battleground episode of Raw on 21 July, after Paige and Lee won a tag match against Emma and Natalya, Paige turned villainous after viciously assaulting Lee.

A month later at Night of Champions, Paige lost the title back to Lee in a triple threat match which also involved Nikki Bella.
