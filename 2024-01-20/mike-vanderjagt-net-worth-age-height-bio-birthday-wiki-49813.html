Michael John Vanderjagt, (/’v ae/n d@r dZ-aet/; born March 24, 1970), is an ex-punter and placekicker who played in the National Football League (NFL). He was primarily associated with the Indianapolis Colts.&nbsp;From 1998 to 2005, he was the Colts’ Placekicker. He also played for the Dallas Cowboys in his last NFL season (2006).&nbsp;He played four seasons in Canada’s Football League (CFL) where he was a member of the Toronto Argonauts, one with the Saskatchewan Roughriders and three with the Toronto Argonauts.</p><p>Vanderjagt was their regular punter and placekicker for the next two seasons. Argos won both the Grey Cup 1996 and 1997. In those games, he was 9 out of 9.&nbsp;He was awarded the title of game’s outstanding Canadian for his 1996 Grey Cup efforts.&nbsp;In 1997, he was also the CFL’s leading punter in yards per attempt.&nbsp;Vanderjagt was released by the Argos in 1997 to be a free agent and eventually to join the National Football League.</p><p>In a 2000 playoff game against Miami, Vanderjagt successfully converted a 50-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, but missed a 49-yard attempt in overtime. Miami scored on the next possession to win the game.</p><p>However, he remained on the roster, when the team was forced to keep backup kicker Shaun Suisham for the first game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Vanderjagt would appear in each of the Cowboys’ subsequent games through Week 12. In Week 9, his potential game-winning field goal was blocked by the Washington Redskins as time expired. In Week 11 against his former team the Colts, he missed his only two field goal attempts, (both of these misses were also wide right) making it the first time since 2001 since he had done so. The fans were so upset, they booed a commercial he appeared in on stadium monitors. After he barely made a 22-yard field goal against Tampa Bay, the Cowboys had seen enough. On November 27, he was released and replaced with Martín Gramática. During his time with the Cowboys, Vanderjagt made 13 of 18 field goal attempts and was 2-for-5 on field goals from 35 yards or more.</p><p align=justify>He graduated from WVU in 1993 and returned to Canada in order to pursue a career with the Canadian Football League.&nbsp;He was cut by four CFL teams between 1993 and 1996. In 1993, he played with the Saskatchewan Roughriders.&nbsp;Vanderjagt was not a member of the league in 1995 or 1994. He played for the Tampa Bay Storm in the Arena Football League.&nbsp;Vanderjagt was also a player for the AFL’s Minnesota Fighting Pike during the 1996 season, before returning to Toronto Argonauts (who had previously removed him twice) for their 1996 season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike Vanderjagt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vanderjagt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oakville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ontario</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Janalyn Vanderjagt</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jay Michael</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike Vanderjagt ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

(In 1998, Minnesota kicker Gary Anderson was perfect in the regular season, but missed a field goal attempt in the playoffs.) In the process, he made his first Pro Bowl and was named first team All-Pro. He finished the regular season 37 for 37 in field goals and 46 for 46 in PATs. He was also perfect on three field-goal attempts and 12 PATs in the postseason. He did, however, miss a potential game tying 51-yard field goal in that season’s Pro Bowl with three seconds left in a 55–52 loss to the NFC.</p><h2>Mike Vanderjagt Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mike Vanderjagt is one of the <strong>richest American Football Player</strong> from Canada.

Patriots safety Rodney Harrison fired back at him in an interview, calling him “Vanderjerk”. Harrison’s teammate, linebacker Willie McGinest, was more temperate in his response, but noted that “there’s going to be a whole bunch of plays when he’s not going to be out there [on the field]. The rest of his guys will be out there dealing with it.” The Patriots eventually defeated the Colts 20–3 and went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX.</p><p>Vanderjagt’s streak of 42 consecutive successful field goal attempts, the second longest in NFL history (the league does not include postseason or Pro Bowl games when compiling streaks), ended on September 9, 2004 when he missed a 48-yard attempt against the New England Patriots.
