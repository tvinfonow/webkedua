Soon afterwards, when he was six, he was also despatched to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as he was unable to make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper Helena Stormanns, who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from her as much as he could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.</p><p>Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Dickinson began his career in music fronting small pub bands in the 1970s while attending school in Sheffield and university in London. In 1979, he joined British new wave heavy metal band Samson, with whom he gained some popularity under the stage name “Bruce Bruce” and performed on two studio records. He left Samson in 1981 to join Iron Maiden, replacing Paul Di’Anno, and debuted on their 1982 album The Number of the Beast. During his first tenure in the band, they issued a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums in the 1980s.</p><p align=justify>He has three children , Austin, Griffin, and Kia together with the spouse Paddy Bowden, whom he was married in the year 90.&nbsp;The couple was earlier married Jane Dickinson from 1983 to 1987.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bruce Dickinson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bruce</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dickinson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Metal Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Worksop</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Paddy Bowden , Jane Dickinson</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Austin Dickinson, Kia Michelle Dickinson, Griffin Dickinson</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bruce Dickinson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to Dickinson, the band was called Speed because of the way in which they played, rather than a reference to drug-taking. In Speed, Dickinson began writing his own material after White taught him how to play three chords on the guitar.</p><h2>Bruce Dickinson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Bruce Dickinson is one of the <strong>richest Metal Singer</strong> from United Kingdom.

Immediately following the completion of his University work, he met up with the band at Greenwich’s Wood Wharf studios to learn the Survivors album. Although the tracks did not suit his vocal style, the band soon wrote the majority of the following Head On album in their earliest rehearsal sessions, some of which were immediately incorporated into their live set.</p><p>While fronting the band, Dickinson also came across Iron Maiden for the first time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980. As Dickinson recalls; “I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and at that moment, I remember thinking, ‘I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, I’m going to sing for that band! I know I’m going to sing for that band!’ … I just thought, ‘This is really me.

He had overheard two other pupils talking about their band and that they needed a singer and so volunteered immediately. They rehearsed in the garage of the drummer’s father, and the band were impressed by Dickinson’s singing, encouraging him to buy his first microphone. Their first gig took place at the Broadfield Tavern in Sheffield. Originally called “Paradox”, the band changed their name on Dickinson’s suggestion to “Styx”, unaware of the American act with the same name. They made local newspaper headlines when a steel worker was awoken by their performance and tried to smash the band’s drum kit. Soon afterwards the band split up.</p><p align=justify>Iron Maiden had a strict and organised routine that suited the band’s writing style, which Dickinson described as a “time table”. After a few gigs, they began writing new material for their third album, The Number of the Beast, released in 1982. In the wake of Samson’s contractual problems, Dickinson could not legally be credited on any of the record’s songs, having to make, what he called, a “moral contribution”, later revealing that he had contributed to “The Prisoner”, “Children of the Damned” and “Run to the Hills”. In the documentary 12 Wasted Years, manager Rod Smallwood refers to “The Prisoner” as being co-written by Dickinson and Adrian Smith. The album was a major success, topping the UK charts, and earning platinum status in the UK and the US. Following the release, the band embarked on a supporting tour around the globe.</p><h2>Who is Bruce Dickinson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Bruce Dickinson</strong> married to <strong>Paddy Bowden , Jane Dickinson </strong>.
