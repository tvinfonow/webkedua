Hsieh started the season in the inaugural Shenzhen Open as fourth seed.&nbsp;Annika Beck defeated her in the second round.&nbsp;Peng Shuai, her regular doubles partner, defeated Hsieh in the second round of the Hobart International.&nbsp;Hsieh was seeded at the Australian Open for the first time in a Grand Slam Singles tournament.&nbsp;She was seeded 26th. She won her first round match against Lara Arruabarrena Vecino, but lost the second round to Svetlana Kuznetsova, a two-time Grand Slam champion.&nbsp;Hsieh and Peng lost in doubles to Sara Errani (top seeds) and Roberta Vinci (third round).&nbsp;Hsieh and Rohan Bopanna reached the quarterfinals of mixed doubles. They lost to Marcin Matkowski and Kveta Perschke.</p><p>2006: Hsieh lost to Tamarine Tanasugarn, a former top-20 player. However, she won her first Grand Slam main draw match and advanced to the second round of the women’s doubles tournament.&nbsp;However, she was more successful at her next Grand Slams.&nbsp;Hsieh lost in the first round to Mathilde Johansson, a local wildcard.&nbsp;Hsieh also qualified for Wimbledon’s main draw, but she was defeated in her first match by Anabel Medina, who is 23rd. She also lost in the first round of doubles.&nbsp;Hsieh was unable to make it to the US Open. She lost to Kirsten Flipkens at the last hurdle.&nbsp;Hsieh was able to achieve much better results on the ITF Circuit. She reached two singles finals and six doubles finals and won one singles title and four doubles titles, respectively.</p><p>Su-wei started 2008 by winning three matches to qualify for the Australian Open, where she won her first main-draw Grand Slam match, defeating Klára Zakopalová in three sets. In the second round, she beat 19th seed Sybille Bammer and defeated Aravane Rezaï in the third round to become first Taiwanese tennis player to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam. She then lost in the fourth round to the world No. 1, Justine Henin, in straight sets. The result would lift her into the top 100 for the first time. She reached the doubles final at the Thailand Open in February with Vania King, losing to compatriots Chuang and Chan Yung-jan.</p><p>While she is primarily known for her doubles prowess, Hsieh has also found decent success on the singles tour. Most of her singles success has come on hard courts, where she has won all three of her WTA titles, as well as reached the fourth round at the Australian Open in 2008 and 2018, a Premier 5 semifinal at the Dubai Tennis Championships in 2019, and a Premier Mandatory quarterfinal at the Miami Open in 2019. However, she has also been successful on other surfaces, including reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2018, the third round at the same tournament in both 2012 and 2019, and the third round of the French Open in 2017. Hsieh has recorded singles victories over several top 10 and top 5 players, including Simona Halep, Naomi Osaka, Garbiñe Muguruza, Angelique Kerber, Karolína Plíšková, Aryna Sabalenka, Johanna Konta, Daniela Hantuchová, Anastasija Sevastova, Kimiko Date-Krumm, Flavia Pennetta, Jelena Ostapenko, Agnieszka Radwańska, Caroline Wozniacki, and Lucie Šafářová.</p><p align=justify>Hsieh was able to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open Junior Grand Slam girls singles event and the round 16 in the girls doubles competition with Natalie Ko. However, she lost in two sets against eventual champions Barbora Zahlavova–Strycova and Petra Cetkovska.&nbsp;As a 15 year old, Hsieh had amazing results during the 2001 season.&nbsp;From January to November, Hsieh competed on the ITF Women’s Circuit and won all five of her events at Wellington, Kaohsiung Bangkok (twice) and Peachtree city.&nbsp;Hsieh reached the semi-finals in Bali, and the quarterfinals at Pattaya on her first WTA Tour event.&nbsp;She only played seven tournaments in 2001. However, her record was impressive at 41-2. In addition, she started her career with 37 wins.&nbsp;She was also successful on the doubles circuit, reaching two finals and ultimately winning one.&nbsp;In 2002, she participated in the qualifying rounds for all four Grand Slam tournaments but was not able to progress to the main draws in any.&nbsp;After a quiet 2003 Hsieh saw a rise in doubles play in 2004. She reached five finals on ITF’s tour and won a pair of titles at Incheon, New Delhi.&nbsp;At 18 years old, she reached her first WTA duals final at Hansol Korea Open. She was beaten by local players Cho Yoon-jeong & Jeon Mi-ra.&nbsp;In 2005, she made her Grand Slam main-draw debut by qualifying at the US Open. She was defeated by Katarina Strebotnik in round one.&nbsp;She had won 10 singles titles, and 11 singles titles in the ITF Circuit by the end of 2005.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hsieh Su-wei</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hsieh</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Su-wei</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tennis Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1986</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hsinchu</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taiwan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Hsieh Tze-lung , Ho Fom-ju</strong></td></tr><tr readability=7><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Hsieh Cheng-peng, Hsieh Yu-chieh, Hsieh Shu-ting, Hsieh Cheng-yen, Hsieh Cheng-ying, Hsieh Chen-an</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Hsieh Su-wei ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Hsieh also struggled remarkably with doubles during the year, failing to make a single quarterfinal at WTA level. Her best result on tour came in a third round appearance at the Australian Open, also marking the first time since 2010 she failed to advance to the quarterfinals in at least one of the Grand Slams. As a result, she dropped down to playing primarily on the ITF level for most of the season, where she managed to win the doubles title in Marseille, a $10k title in Porto, and finishing as the runner-up in the doubles draw in Dubai. While her ITF level results managed to keep her inside the top 100, nonetheless, her year-end ranking of No. 96 marked her worst finish in ten years.</p><h2>Hsieh Su-wei Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Hsieh Su-wei is one of the <strong>richest Tennis Player</strong> from Taiwan.

She then reached her first singles quarterfinal at a WTA grass court event in Birmingham, where she was beaten by Ekaterina Makarova. She also won the doubles title with Tímea Babos over the world No. 1’s, Americans Lisa Raymond and Liezel Huber, her first grass court doubles title. Entering Wimbledon ranked inside the top 70, Hsieh scored her first win at the All England Club in four years by defeating French wildcard Virginie Razzano, who just a month earlier at the French Open became the first player ever to beat Serena Williams in the opening round of a Grand Slam, in straight sets. She followed it up with a win over Stéphanie Fortez Gacon to advance to the third round of Wimbledon for the first time, and beyond the second round of a major for the first time since the 2008 Australian Open. Though she would lose at this stage to then-world No. 1 and recent French Open winner, Maria Sharapova, in straight sets, this marked Hsieh’s best performance at a Grand Slam in four and a half years. She also reached the quarterfinals in the mixed doubles tournament, partnering with British player Colin Fleming. Following Wimbledon, she reached a new career-high singles ranking of world No. 56.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tennis Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Entering the summer hard court season, Hsieh reunited with her friend and compatriot Chuang Chia-jung, whom she would spend the majority of the rest of the season playing with. Their first tournament back was at the Cincinnati Masters, where they reached the semifinals. En route, she was able to get revenge on Babos and Mladenovic, who had beaten her at Wimbledon, with a win over the pair in the quarterfinals. Hsieh decided to play with Anastasia Rodionova, though, instead of Chuang at the US Open. The pair, seeded tenth, were upset in the second round by Anna-Lena Grönefeld and CoCo Vandeweghe. She also played mixed doubles with Henri Kontinen, where they reached the quarterfinals. Hsieh played two more tournaments with Chuang, the inaugural Dongfeng Motor Open in Wuhan and in Beijing, but they lost both opening round matches. She finished the year ranked 107th in singles and 26th in doubles.</p><p>During the clay season, she fell in first round of the Madrid Open, Italian Open, and French Open and the second round of the Internationaux de Strasbourg in singles, but won the Italian Open with Peng, her tenth career doubles title. While Hsieh would struggle throughout the rest of the season on the singles court, winning five of her next eighteen matches, and her best results being second round showings at the next two Grand Slam events, her Italian Open title sparked the beginning of what would go on to be a remarkable run of doubles titles and domination over the next twelve months. After a disappointing second round loss at the French Open, and quarterfinal losses at both grass court warmup tournaments, Hsieh and Penn came into Wimbledon as the dark horse candidates for the title. Seeded eighth, the pair wizzed through to the final with the loss of just one set, and without having to face a single seeded team. Facing the twelfth seeded Australian duo of Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua, they won the title in two sets. This was Hsieh’s first Grand Slam title, making her the first Taiwanese tennis player to ever win one in any discipline. It also meant she would return to the top 10 rankings for the first time since January 2010.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Hsieh Su-wei height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Hsieh <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Hsieh opened the 2009 season by winning the doubles title with Peng at her first tournament of the year, the Premier-level Sydney International, defeating Nathalie Dechy and hometown favorite Casey Dellacqua in the final. At the Australian Open, she was upset by compatriot Chan Yung-jan in the first round of women’s singles. As a result, she dropped out of top 100. In women’s doubles, however, she and Peng fared much better. As the 16th seeds, the pair recorded back to back three set wins to advance to the third round, where they pulled off a major upset with a straight sets win over the second seeds Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual, losing just one game, thereby advancing Hsieh to her first major quarterfinals. However, the pair was defeated in the last eight by the eventual champions, 10th-seeded Serena Williams and Venus Williams.</p><p align=justify>At the Cincinnati Open, Hsieh lost in the first round in singles, but made it to the finals in doubles with Kazakh partner Yaroslava Shvedova. However, the pair were topped by the Russian duo of Maria Kirilenko and Nadia Petrova in a third set super-tiebreak. She then went on to record her first main draw win at the US Open over Evgeniya Rodina before losing to Petrova in the second round. Hsieh then managed to end the year strong by winning the Bali International with Peng Shuai and defending her title in Korea with compatriot Chuang. She finished the year ranked inside the top 100 in singles for the first time, at No. 79, and 53rd in doubles.</p><h2>Who is Hsieh Su-wei Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Hsieh Su-wei</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in Taiwan</strong>. Hsieh Su-wei celebrates birthday on January 4 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Hsieh got off to a slow start to the summer hard-court season. She played just one tournament between the Olympics and the US Open, the Texas Tennis Open. In singles, she was beaten by eventual champion Roberta Vinci in the first round, while falling in the quarterfinals of the doubles tournament with partner Gabriela Dabrowski to Iveta Benešová and Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová. At the US Open, she suffered a three set loss in singles to Magdaléna Rybáriková in the first round, but was successful in the women’s doubles tournament with partner Anabel Medina Garrigues, where they reached the semifinals. Hsieh piled together a hugely successful Asian hard-court season following the Open, winning 17 of her last 21 matches. She won the Ningbo Challenger, a $100k tournament, defeating Zhang Shuai in the final. The next week, she reached the final at the Guangzhou International Open dropping just one set en route. Facing the 17-year old Brit Laura Robson, the silver medalist in mixed doubles with Andy Murray at the Olympics who had defeated both four-time Grand Slam Champion Kim Clijsters and 2011 French Open champion, Li Na, en route to the fourth round at the US Open less than a month earlier, Hsieh played the most intense tennis match of her life. Despite being 0–2 down in each of the first two sets, having five match points saved in the second set, the match being suspended after the second set due to the excruciatingly hot temperatures, and then being 0–3 down in the final set, she fought back to win the title in three sets by a score of 6–3, 5–7, 6–4. This marked Hsieh’s second WTA singles title of the year, and with it she jumped into the top 50 of the singles rankings for the first time, at No. 39. Though her 10-match winning streak was snapped in her very next match at the Pan Pacific Open, she won another $100k ITF singles title two weeks later at the Suzhou Open, her 23rd career ITF singles title. This brought her into the top 25 for the first time, becoming the first Taiwanese tennis player to achieve a ranking that high. Hsieh concluded her season at the Tournament of Champions, where she was invited to compete for the first time. She lost her first two matches to Caroline Wozniacki and Vinci, but ended her year on a high note with a three set victory over Hantuchová. Hsieh finished with her best year-end ranking to date, world No. 25 in singles, a ranking which she equaled in doubles.</p><h3>How old is Hsieh Su Wei?</h3><p>36 years (January 4, 1986)</p><h3>Has Hsieh Su Wei won a Grand Slam?</h3><p>0</p><h3>How tall is Hsieh Su Wei?</h3><p>5′ 7″</p><h3>Why does Hsieh not have a sponsor?</h3><p>Women’s Tennis Blog relates that there are several theories as to why the star is currently sponsorless, “<b>mostly having to do with politics</b>”.
