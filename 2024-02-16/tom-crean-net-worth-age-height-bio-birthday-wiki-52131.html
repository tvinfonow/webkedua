Izzo and Crean became such good friends that Crean lived in Izzo’s house and Izzo was an usher in Crean’s wedding. According to Crean at the time, “It was a great opportunity for me to go back home. We’ve been friends a long time. I don’t think I would have left Ralph for anything else.” During this period Crean served at various times as recruiting coordinator and, for the last two seasons, associate head coach. In each of Crean’s four seasons, Michigan State’s win total increased, culminating with a 33-5 season and a 15-1 Big Ten ledger in 1999.

Dakich had replaced former coach Kelvin Sampson, who resigned after NCAA recruiting violations. Between Crean’s hiring and the start of the 2008–09 season, freshman Eric Gordon opted to leave early for the NBA and star forward DJ White graduated.

As a result, Crean began with a roster consisting only of two walk-ons who had scored a combined 36 points in their careers. Despite the long odds, Crean was known to approach games and practices as if Indiana could compete in each one and to continue stressing Hoosier Hysteria and the long tradition of success at the school. He was well aware that he was walking into a difficult situation. However, when asked why he left Marquette, Crean replied, “It’s Indiana. It’s Indiana, and that is the bottom line.”</p><h3>Who is Tom Crean's wife?</h3><p>Joani Harbaugh</p><h3>What is Tom Crean doing now?</h3><p>University of Georgia On March 15, 2018, Crean was named <b>head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs</b>.</p><h3>Is Tom Crean related to Jim Harbaugh?</h3><p>Tom Crean, Georgia’s basketball head coach, is <b>Harbaugh’s brother-in-law</b>.
