In 37 carries, he amassed 386 yards and scored seven touchdowns, both records for freshmen (the 386 yards were a then-NCAA record). “Faulk had scoring runs of 61, 7, 47, 9, 5, 8 and 25 yards.” [3] That performance sparked one of the greatest freshman seasons in NCAA history, gaining 1,429 yards rushing, with 23 total touchdowns (21 rushing), and 140 points scored. Faulk went on to better 1,600 yards rushing in his sophomore year. In Faulk’s junior season in 1993, he was finally able to showcase his all-purpose ability by catching 47 passes for 640 yards and 3 touchdowns to go with 1,530 yards and 21 touchdowns on the ground. These numbers put Faulk 3rd in the nation in all-purpose yardage that year, and 2nd in scoring. Faulk left San Diego State University with many of the school’s offensive records, among them 5,562 all-purpose yards and 62 career touchdowns, which is the 8th most in NCAA history.</p><p>After his 1992 season at SDSU, Faulk finished second in the Heisman Trophy award voting, losing to quarterback Gino Torretta in what was considered a notable snub in the history of the award: Torretta’s 1992 Miami Hurricanes football team had gone undefeated in the regular season and was ranked No. 1 in the country before the Heisman balloting, Faulk’s team finished with a middling 5-5-1 record, continuing a trend of the Heisman going to the most notable player on one of the nation’s best teams. ESPN analyst Lee Corso led a campaign supporting Torretta for the Heisman and left Marshall Faulk off of his ballot. He was a Heisman finalist as well in 1991 (9th) and 1993 (4th).</p><p align=justify>He was the son of Roosevelt his wife Cecile Faulk.&nbsp;He was married to Lyndsey Stoudt in May 9th the 9th of May, 2006.&nbsp;They had five children.&nbsp;The cousin of his is NFL football player&nbsp;He was born to Roosevelt and Cecile Faulk.

On February 14, 1994, at the NFL Scouting Combine Faulk ran a 4.28 forty-yard dash. and on March 31, he ran a 4.35 forty-yard time at the San Diego State Pro Day. The Bengals held the No. 1 pick in the 1994 NFL Draft, and contemplated combining their heavy-duty runner Harold Green with the explosive Faulk, but eventually picked Wilkinson, leaving Faulk for the Indianapolis Colts.</p><h2>Marshall Faulk Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Marshall Faulk is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Marshall Faulk</b>'s net worth <strong>$12 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was a naughty teenager who was kicked out of three elementary schools.</p><p align=justify>He was the only NFL player to reach 12,000 yards of running and 6,000 yards receiving.</p><p align=justify>Marshall William Faulk (born February 26, 1973) is a former American football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons. He played college football for San Diego State University, and was a two-time consensus All-American. He was selected by the Indianapolis Colts as the second overall pick in the 1994 NFL Draft, and he also played professionally for the NFL’s St. Louis Rams. Faulk was a member of the Greatest Show on Turf, a name given to the St. Louis Rams team that appeared in two Super Bowls and won Super Bowl XXXIV. In 2000, Faulk was named the Most Valuable Player of the NFL. Faulk is one of only three NFL players (Marcus Allen and Tiki Barber being the others) to reach at least 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards; he is the only one to amass 12,000 yards rushing and 6,000 yards receiving. Faulk was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017. He was an analyst for various programs on the NFL Network until December 2017.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In his first year in St. Louis, Faulk was the catalyst for “The Greatest Show on Turf”, a nickname given to coordinator Mike Martz’s aggressive Coryell-style offense. In this offense he put up some of the best all-purpose numbers in the history of the NFL. Faulk’s patience and diligence in learning the Rams’ offense paid off when he totaled an NFL record 2,429 yards from scrimmage, eclipsing Barry Sanders’s record of 2,358 yards set in 1997 (Faulk’s mark has since been broken by Chris Johnson in 2009). With 1,381 yards rushing (5.5 yards-per-carry average), 1,048 receiving yards, and scoring 12 touchdowns, Faulk joined Roger Craig as the only men at that time to total 1,000+ yards in each category in a season. He also broke the NFL season record for most receiving yards by a running back, previously held by Lionel James. The Rams eventually went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV. In the game, Faulk was contained on the ground by Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher’s defensive scheme, limiting him to just 17 rushing yards. This was perhaps due to the Titans’ inability to stop the Rams’ passing game, of which Faulk was a major part, recording 5 receptions for 90 yards. His 90 receiving yards were the second highest total by a running back in Super Bowl history. At the end of the season, he received the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award and was a starter for the NFC squad in the 1999 Pro Bowl.</p><p>The next year was a miserable one for Faulk. Because of a toe injury he suffered earlier in the season, he rushed for only 587 yards, with a 3 yards-per-carry average. He led the Colts in yards from scrimmage with 1,015. He recovered from the injury and rushed for 1,000+ yards in each of the next two seasons, setting a new personal high with 1,319 in 1998. He also caught 86 passes for 906 yards that year (playing alongside rookie quarterback Peyton Manning) and was the AFC & NFL’s leader in total yards from scrimmage with an astounding 2,227, beating out Denver’s MVP running back Terrell Davis by 2 yards, while also finishing 4th in the league in receptions. It would also be the first of an NFL-record 4 consecutive 2,000+ total-yard seasons.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Marshall Faulk height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Marshall <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Faulk was drafted 2nd overall in the 1994 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis Colts, who were in desperate need of a running game. On July 25, 1994, Faulk signed a seven-year $17.2 million contract and received a $5.1 million signing bonus. Faulk responded by rushing for 1,282 yards, 11 touchdowns, and one receiving touchdown. The Colts improved to 8-8. Marshall Faulk, later that season, would become the first NFL player to win both the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award and the Pro Bowl’s Most Valuable Player Award in the same season. He was also the first rookie to win Pro Bowl MVP.</p><p align=justify>The following year, Faulk became the first running back in NFL history to lead his team in receptions five separate seasons (three in Indianapolis and twice in St. Louis). In addition, he was the NFL MVP and again the Offensive Player of the Year in 2000. He had 1,359 yards rushing in 14 games and set a new NFL record with 26 total touchdowns, (a record that would soon be broken by Priest Holmes and then later by Shaun Alexander and LaDainian Tomlinson), despite missing two games due to injury. He also averaged 5+ yards per carry again, this time with 5.4. The Rams, however were not able to replicate the record they had the year prior. Even with the offense scoring the most points and yards during “The Greatest Show on Turf” era, the defense gave up 470 points.</p><h2>Who is Marshall Faulk Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Marshall Faulk</strong> married to <strong>Lindsay Stoudt </strong>.

Faulk had missed practices and was considering holding out for a new contract, and Colts president Bill Polian did not want his young team’s chemistry damaged (especially with the budding Manning at the quarterback position), so he traded Faulk for second and fifth round picks in the upcoming draft (used to draft LB Mike Peterson and DE Brad Scioli). The Colts moved on at the position, drafting Edgerrin James in the first round. Faulk held out for 12 days as the details of his contract were worked out. On August 4, 1999, Faulk signed a seven-year, $45.2 million contract with the Rams, which was the biggest deal in team history at the time. In it Faulk was guaranteed $9.6 million including a $7-million signing bonus. The problem in negotiations was the proposed fifth year, in which Faulk would get $7 million in salary and a $5-million roster bonus. The deal was structured to prevent Faulk from ever being tagged a transition or franchise player.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Marshall Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Football Player</strong>.
