C. Buford hired Brown as an unpaid member of the Spurs’ basketball operations department for the 1998–99 lockout-shortened season. In 2002, after a stint with the Sydney Kings, he again took a position with the Spurs, this time as the team’s director of player development. Buford credited him with focusing attention on the team’s lesser-known players, creating a consistently strong bench; this philosophy would continue to benefit the Spurs even after Brown left his role as player development director. He was promoted to as an assistant coach in September 2007, working under coach Gregg Popovich. Popovich calls Brown “one of his best friends,” and Brown would later incorporate many of Popovich’s concepts into his own offensive system. He played a major role in signing Australian guard Patty Mills, who played under him for the Australian national team. Brown was a member of the Spurs organization for four of their championship-winning seasons.</p><p>During the 2013 NBA off-season, Brown was offered a chance to succeed Mike Budenholzer as the top assistant on Gregg Popovich’s staff, but in August 2013, he chose instead to become head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. He inherited a team in “total rebuilding mode” led by new general manager Sam Hinkie, and the Sixers were only able to woo Brown away from the Spurs after offering a 4-year guaranteed contract. His appointment made him the 24th head coach in the history of the franchise, and the second person to be a head coach in both the NBL and the NBA, following Mike Dunlap. The Sixers were the youngest team in the league during Brown’s first year, and one of the youngest of all time. During the second half of the 2013–14 season, the Sixers would lose 26 games in a row, tying the record for longest NBA losing streak. Sixers point guard Michael Carter-Williams won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in 2014, and credited Brown for helping him win the award and grow as a player.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Brett Brown height</b> Not available right now.
