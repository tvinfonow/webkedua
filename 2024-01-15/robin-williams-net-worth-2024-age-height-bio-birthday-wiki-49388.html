Williams stated that “It was a good springboard for a coaching career because we had GB rowers there. We won a lot of stuff at all levels and I think that got me established as a coach.” In 1996 he coached the lightweight men’s four to 10th place at the Olympics in Atlanta.</p><p>From 2005 until 2009 he coached the men’s lightweight crews for Team GB at Henley on Thames and the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake in Caversham, Berkshire.
