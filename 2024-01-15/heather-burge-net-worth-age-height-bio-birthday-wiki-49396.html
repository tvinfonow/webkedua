After playing basketball at Virginia, she was a former professional basketball player. She spent one season with the Sacramento Monarchs.&nbsp;Poppi Monroe played her in Double Teamed, a 2002 Disney Channel movie about her life and early basketball career.</p><p>She was a minor character in the movie Juwanna Man, which starred&nbsp;Vivica Fox.</p><p>Prior to starting high school, the Burge family moved to Palos Verdes Estates, California so that the sisters could attend Palos Verdes High School. Burge also brought success to the team, transforming the Sea Kings into Southern Section 3-A champions in 1987 and concluding her high school career atop the school’s all-time list of girls’ scorers with 1,345 points. After graduation, both sisters accepted scholarships to attend the University of Virginia and play for the Lady Cavaliers basketball team. Although the pair attended the same school, they did not live together or even have the same circle of friends. The Burges also did not play the same position on the court as Heidi preferred the outside game and Heather (who is 6 minutes older than Heidi) played inside against the opposing teams’ centers and was the go-to scorer in the paint.</p><p>UVA would win right away with Burge averaging 12.2 points and 6.7 rebounds a game her freshman year and the pair playing a big part in leading the team to the school’s first three, and to date only, Atlantic Coast Conference championships (in 1990, 1992 and 1993) and Women’s NCAA Final Four appearances (1990–1992). Following the school year in 1989 and 1990, Burge was asked to play for USA Basketball U18 and U19 basketball teams and won a gold medal at the 1990 US Olympic Festival. Things did not always go smoothly for the Burges in their freshman and sophomore seasons as the pair were frequently in foul trouble, rarely played at the same time on the court (due to their foul situation), fought with teammates and each other, and were considered by their teammates to be both “soft” and prone to mistakes and turnovers.</p><p align=justify>She is the twin sister to&nbsp;She is the twin sister of <a href=#>Heidi Burge</a>..</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Heather Burge</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Heather</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Burge</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1971</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fairfax</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Heidi Burge</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Darren Quella</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Heather Burge ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
