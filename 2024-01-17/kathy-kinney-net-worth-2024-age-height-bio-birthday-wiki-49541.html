Her boss enjoyed hunting, and sometimes she chatted with him about his hunting trips, occasionally quipping, “So, did you kill anything this week?” She used this experience to inspire herself for the role of Mimi. During this time at WCBS she worked nights at New York comedy clubs to improve her improvisational comedy skills. This led to a job teaching improv classes. Bill Sherwood, a director, attended.

Critics occasionally grumble that Mimi, her character on The Drew Carey Show, is a waddling fat joke, but her weight has never seemed to be the point of a fat joke. “One time I had to say to Drew, ‘Aw, you’re just fat,’ as the ultimate put-down. I personally don’t like it, but if fat jokes slip in because they’re funny, I don’t care.” She is, however, less comfortable about being typecast because of her weight. “Once in a while I would lose some weight, just by accident, and someone would say to me, ‘You’re going to diet yourself out of a career,'” she says. “And I tell them, ‘I’m losing weight, not my talent.’ Why is it the first thing [some people] look at is the shape? It points up to me the prejudice that still exists.” The Mimi Bobeck character was written only into the pilot of The Drew Carey Show. The character interviewed for a cosmetics job at Winfred-Louder and when not hired, because of her garish makeup, raised a big fuss and threatened to sue. Positive public reaction prompted the Mimi storyline to continue, as the store hired her as a secretary to prevent her from suing. The show aired from 1995 to 2004.</p><p align=justify>In March 2010, Kinney co-authored with Cindy Ratzlaff a book entitled Queen of Your Own Life: The Grown-up Woman’s Guide to Claiming Happiness and Getting the Life You Deserve, published by Harlequin.</p><h2>Who is Kathy Kinney Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kathy Kinney</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
