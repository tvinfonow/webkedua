He was a five-time NBA champion, three times Finals MVP, and three-time NBA MVP. He spent his entire 13 year career with the Los Angeles Lakers.&nbsp;He was named to 12 NBA All-Star teams and led the league with assists four times.&nbsp;After being diagnosed with HIV, his performance in 1992 All-Star games earned him the MVP Award.</p><p>After being beaten in five games by the Chicago Bulls in 1991’s NBA Finals, he admired&nbsp;He admired <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a> and his basketball talent, especially after he was beaten by his Chicago Bulls in five games in the 1991 NBA Finals.’s basketball skills.</p><p>Johnson and Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson’s Michigan State squad defeated Bird’s Indiana State team in the 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson’s daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning.</p><p>Magic Johnson had an extremely close relationship with Lakers owner Jerry Buss, whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure. Calling Buss his “second father” and “one of [his] best friends”, Johnson spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital just a few months before his death from cancer. Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, “Without Dr. Jerry Buss, there is no Magic.” Buss acquired the team from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the 1979 NBA draft. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994.

He missed 45&nbsp;games, and said that his rehabilitation was the “most down” he had ever felt. Johnson returned before the start of the 1981 playoffs, but the Lakers’ then-assistant and future head coach Pat Riley later said Johnson’s much-anticipated return made the Lakers a “divided team”.

Although Andre was raised by his mother, he visited Johnson each summer, and later worked for Magic Johnson Enterprises as a marketing director. In 1991, Johnson married Earlitha “Cookie” Kelly in a small wedding in Lansing which included guests Thomas, Aguirre, and Herb Williams. Johnson and Cookie have one son, Earvin III (EJ), who is openly gay and a star on the reality show Rich Kids of Beverly Hills. The couple adopted a daughter, Elisa, in 1995. Johnson resides in Beverly Hills and has a vacation home in Dana Point, California.</p><p>In 1981, after the 1980–81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $25&nbsp;million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point. Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers “slow” and “predictable”. After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner Jerry Buss fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley. Although Johnson denied responsibility for Westhead’s firing, he was booed across the league, even by Laker fans. However, Buss was also unhappy with the Lakers’ offense and had intended on firing Westhead days before the Westhead–Johnson altercation, but assistant GM Jerry West and GM Bill Sharman had convinced Buss to delay his decision. Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson averaged 18.6&nbsp;points, 9.6&nbsp;rebounds, 9.5&nbsp;assists, and a league-high 2.7&nbsp;steals per game, and was voted a member of the All-NBA Second Team. He also joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only NBA players to tally at least 700&nbsp;points, 700&nbsp;rebounds, and 700&nbsp;assists in the same season. The Lakers advanced through the 1982 playoffs and faced Philadelphia for the second time in three years in the 1982 NBA Finals. After a triple-double from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4–2, as Johnson won his second NBA Finals MVP award. During the championship series against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2&nbsp;points on .533&nbsp;shooting, 10.8&nbsp;rebounds, 8.0&nbsp;assists, and 2.5&nbsp;steals per game.

Johnson said that what was “most amazing” about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the team’s 7&nbsp;ft 2&nbsp;in (2.18&nbsp;m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history. Despite Abdul-Jabbar’s dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal. Lakers coach Jack McKinney had the 6-foot-9-inch (2.06&nbsp;m) rookie Johnson, who some analysts thought should play forward, be a point guard, even though incumbent Norm Nixon was already one of the best in the league. Johnson averaged 18.0&nbsp;points, 7.7&nbsp;rebounds, and 7.3&nbsp;assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.</p><p align=justify>During the 1982–83 NBA season, Johnson averaged 16.8&nbsp;points, 10.5&nbsp;assists, and 8.6&nbsp;rebounds per game and earned his first All-NBA First Team nomination. The Lakers again reached the Finals, and for a third time faced the Sixers, who featured center Moses Malone as well as Erving. With Johnson’s teammates Nixon, James Worthy, and Bob McAdoo all hobbled by injuries, the Lakers were swept by the Sixers, and Malone was crowned the Finals MVP. In a losing effort against Philadelphia, Johnson averaged 19.0&nbsp;points on .403&nbsp;shooting, 12.5&nbsp;assists, and 7.8&nbsp;rebounds per game.</p><h2>Who is Magic Johnson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Magic Johnson</strong> married to <strong>Cookie Johnson </strong>.

Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must’ve thrown it through somebody.” Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair.
