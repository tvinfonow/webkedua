Christina Hammock Koch (/k oU K / ; born on 29 January 1979) is an American engineer and NASA astronaut from 2013, the year of her birth.&nbsp;She graduated with the Bachelor of Science degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics, as well as the Master of Science of Electrical Engineering at North Carolina State University.&nbsp;She also pursued advanced study as a part of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).&nbsp;Prior to her becoming an astronaut was employed in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as the Station Chief of American Samoa.</p><p>Between 2007 and in 2009 Koch was an electrical engineer within the Space Department of the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University focusing on developing instruments for space science.&nbsp;Koch contributed to instruments studying the effects of radiation on NASA missions, such as The Juno as well as the Van Allen Probes.&nbsp;In the next season, Koch was able to complete tours at Palmer Station in Antarctica and numerous Winter seasons in Summit Station in Greenland.&nbsp;The year 2012 was the first time she was employed for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in two roles first as Field Engineer in the NOAA’s Global Monitoring Division Baseline Observatory in Barrow Alaska, and then as the Station Chief of the American Samoa Observatory.</p><p>In June 2013, Koch was selected by NASA as part of Astronaut Group 21. She completed training in July 2015, making her available for future missions. Her Astronaut Candidate Training included scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in International Space Station systems, spacewalks, robotics, physiological training, T‐38 flight training, and water and wilderness survival training.</p><p>On April 17, 2019, due to reassignment schedules with the Commercial Crew Development program, her mission was extended to February 2020, returned to Earth on Thursday, Feb. 6 after 328 days – which is the longest single continuous stay in space for a woman, exceeding Peggy Whitson’s 289 days. In addition, for a first-time astronaut, this NASA mission change has never happened before. Koch’s extended mission is being used to study the physical, biological, and mental effects of long-term space travel on women.</p><p align=justify>Koch was Research Associate for the United States Antarctic Program from 2004 until 2007, and spent three and a half years travelling across the Arctic as well as the Antarctic regions.&nbsp;She spent a winter-over time at the Amundsen Scott South Pole Station, where she endured temperatures as low as minus-111°F (-79.4 C) temperatures.&nbsp;She also spent a second period in Palmer Station.&nbsp;In Antarctica, Koch served as an integral part in the Firefighting Teams and Ocean/Glacier Search and Rescue Teams.&nbsp;Koch has described her time on Antarctica’s South Pole as challenging mentally and physically “[This] means going months without seeing the sun, with the same crew, and without shipments of mail or fresh food. The isolation, absence of family and friends, and lack of new sensory inputs are all conditions that you must find a strategy to thrive within.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Christina Koch</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Christina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Koch</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Engineer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1979</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Grand Rapids</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Robert Koch</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Christina Koch ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
