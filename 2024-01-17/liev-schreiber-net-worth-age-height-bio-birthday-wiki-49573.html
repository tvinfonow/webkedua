She was “a highly cultured eccentric” who earned a living by splitting her time between driving a cab and creating papier-mâché puppets.” On Schreiber’s 16th birthday, his mother bought him a motorcycle to “promote fearlessness.” The critic John Lahr wrote in a 1999 New Yorker profile that, “To a large extent, Schreiber’s professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother’s eccentricities. It’s both his grief and his gift.” Her bohemian proclivities led to actions such as making Schreiber take the Hindu name Shiva Das, wear yoga shirts, consume a vegetarian diet, and briefly attend Satchidananda Ashram in Pomfret, Connecticut when he was 12. Schreiber’s mother also forbade her son from seeing color movies. As a result, his favorite actors were Charlie Chaplin, Andrew Cartwright and Basil Rathbone. In retrospect, Schreiber said in a 2008 interview that he appreciates his mother’s influences, saying: “Since I’ve had Sasha, I’ve completely identified with everything my mother went through raising me… and I think her choices were inspired.”</p><p>Schreiber has narrated a number of documentaries, many of them aired as part of PBS series such as American Experience, Nova, and Secrets of the Dead from 2001-11.
