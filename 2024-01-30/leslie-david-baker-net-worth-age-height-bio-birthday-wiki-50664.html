It was said that his performance was “a standout” on the show, and with “his monotone voice and calm demeanor, he played well against the off-the-wall nature of many of the other characters.” “Did I Stutter?” (season 4, 2008) has a focus on Baker’s character; as with many supporting actors on The Office, some of Baker’s scenes became memorable to fans. Stanley is rarely, but sometimes, given a “soft side”; in “Stairmageddon” (season 9, 2013), Baker plays a tranquilized, and then giddy, Stanley. At the conclusion of the series, Stanley says he is happy to be living in retirement in Florida.</p><h2>Who is Leslie David Baker Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Leslie David Baker</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
