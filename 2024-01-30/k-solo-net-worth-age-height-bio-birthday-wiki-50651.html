But before this all came about K-Solo spent 16 months in Riverhead Correctional Facility after being wrongfully convicted of assault in the 1980s. In Suffolk jail is where K-Solo came up with the Spellbound flow. Mr. Myles was there to see him write it.That was before he transferred to the city jail.</p><p>During the mid-1990s through the early 2000s (decade), DMX and K-Solo, who first met as inmates in prison during the course of K-Solo’s three-year prison stint, disputed over who was the first to write “Spellbound”. Despite that K-Solo released his version in 1990, DMX, who released his version in 1994, claimed that he was the first to write “Spellbound”. In his 1998 hit single “Get At Me Dog”, DMX told K-Solo to “suck [his] dick”. K-Solo later responded to DMX on a track named “The Answer Back”, in which K-Solo claimed to be DMX’s real father, and alleged that the legitimate reason for DMX’s disgruntlement was because K-Solo had given DMX’s mother a sexually transmitted infection. As the track continues, K-Solo went on to vindicate himself by saying that it was in fact DMX’s mother that had “burned” him first. On Beef II, K-Solo took a lie detector test to prove that he was the first to write “Spellbound”. The results were inconclusive.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>K-Solo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lonnie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dupre</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>K-Solo ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

I ran with one of these guys who was in the hood. A while back, my boy – Ralph Mann got jumped by a few of the L.O.D. cats Keith Murray’s crew]. They were disrespecting Ralph! I put Murray and Redman in the game! So, I put they asses on blast on a mixtape! Murray’s men jumped me on stage and threw me off the bitch. They’re now in court because of the shit. But let me ask you – how do I get jumped in your club on Christmas Eve and walk out still alright? I could’ve respected it if Murray ran up on me and did his thing. But he didn’t. He thinks that the world is against him. If there was no Kevin Madison there wouldn’t be no Keith Murray, because no one would’ve respected him. Why fight someone that put you on? The only thing that I can think is that Reggie and Erick put him on to doing it. These cats are crazy, though. People were hurt when the Hit Squad broke up. I know people who can call on J. Prince and really cause some problems. Cats are just stupid. That’s the only thing that aggravates me. What else do I have to do to show people that I’m the “original rap criminal”? People don’t know what they’re playing with.”</p><h3>When did K-Solo come out?</h3><table readability=1><tr>No.<td>3.</td></tr><tr readability=2>Title<td>“Long Live the Fugitive”</td></tr><tr>Producer(s)<td>K-Solo</td></tr><tr>Length<td>1:49</td></tr></table><h3>How old is rapper K-Solo?</h3><p>54&nbsp;years (April 17, 1968)</p><h3>Who is Solo the rapper?</h3><table readability=2><tr>K-Solo</tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Years active</td><td>1987-present</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Labels</td><td>Atlantic, Death Row, Waste Management</td></tr></table><h3>Where is the rapper K Solo from?</h3><p>Long Island, NY</p><h3>Who did solo Lucci date?</h3><p>Love & Hip Hop franchise (2017–2019) Later, he briefly dates <b>Chanel West Coast</b>.</p>You may read full biography about K-Solo from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfoHq0u8uoZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=/2024-01-30/katie-pavlich-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-50687.html>&#171;&nbsp;Katie Pavlich Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a>
