In May 1987, his television debut came with a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World. In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the CBS sitcom Trial and Error and the ABC sitcom Growing Pains. He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall). Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street. In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt’s films to reach theaters.

Ken Tucker, television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote: “Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he’s really scary.” The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image. His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder. After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott’s 1991 road film Thelma & Louise. He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol. After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star, and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World, although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.</p><p>Pitt first gained recognition as a cowboy hitchhiker in the road movie Thelma & Louise (1991). His first leading roles in big-budget productions came with the drama films A River Runs Through It (1992) and Legends of the Fall (1994), and the horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994).

He participated in the school’s Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals. Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—”a portal into different worlds for me”—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made. Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs. He has named his early acting heroes as Gary Oldman, Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke.</p><p align=justify>1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt’s career. Starring as the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice’s 1976 novel of the same name, he was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas. Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony, his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, “Brad Pitt&nbsp;[…] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side&nbsp;[…] he’s a joy to watch. But there’s nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.” Following the release of Interview with the Vampire, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994), based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant, Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category. Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt’s brothers. Although the film’s reception was mixed, many film critics praised Pitt’s performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, “Pitt’s diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it’s a shame the film’s superficiality gets in his way.” The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt’s reputation as a lead actor.</p><h2>Who is Brad Pitt Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Brad Pitt</strong> married to <strong>Angelina Jolie , Jennifer Aniston </strong>.

His portrayal of the character was described by People’ s Janet Mock as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could be more than a “cowboy-hatted hunk.” He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it was one of his “weakest performances&nbsp;… It’s so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for.” Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying “when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better.” In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis’s character in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as “outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace.” Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film. He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.</p><h2>Top Facts about Brad Pitt</h2><li>Brad Pitt was born on December 18, 1963.</li><li>He has won an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards.</li><li>Pitt’s net worth is estimated at $300 million.</li><li>He has been named People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive twice.</li><li>Pitt has starred in over 70 films and TV shows.</li><li>His breakout role was in the movie “Thelma & Louise” (1991).</li><li>Pitt co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment.</li><li>He has six children with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.</li><li>In addition to acting, he is also a philanthropist and activist.</li><li>Pitt supports various causes including environmental conservation and LGBTQ rights.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Brad Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Movie Actor</strong>.
