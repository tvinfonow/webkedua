In 2005, he returned to Augsburg, who were impressed with his ability at coaching youth players, and was provided with the role of youth team co-ordinator. Tuchel held the position for three years, eventually transitioning into management after being offered the position as first team coach at Augsburg II for the 2007–08 season.</p><h2>Thomas Tuchel Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Thomas Tuchel is one of the <strong>richest Soccer Coach</strong> from Germany. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Thomas Tuchel</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He played soccer as a child with TSV Krumbach, and FC Augsburg before making his debut as a professional as a player with the Stuttgarter Kickers in 1992.</p><p align=justify>His playing career ran between 1992 and 1998, the bulk of which was during his time playing for SSV Ulm.</p><p align=justify>Tuchel quickly set to revitalizing the team, a task made much easier as Dortmund’s financial situation greatly contrasted Mainz’s, as well as having relatively better players. He conducted his transfer business early in the window, allowing the departures of nine first-team players, while purchasing German midfielders Gonzalo Castro and Julian Weigl from Bayer Leverkusen and 1860 Munich, respectively. Both became the fulcrum of the system Tuchel deployed at the club, as he aimed to replicate the dynamic offense displayed during the final season of his tenure at Mainz, where he encouraged a more rotational system of passing. Castro and Weigl, who were adapted from defensively-minded midfielders to a box-to-box midfielder and deep-lying playmaker respectively, allowed Tuchel to experiment with various formations with a solid base at the center of the park. Alongside their use of pressing and pace, the team were able to transition from a 4-1-4-1, 4–2–3-1, and 3–4–3 with relative ease throughout the campaign, which saw them enjoy strong domestic success by finishing runners-up in the Bundesliga, which included a run of 11 consecutive wins to begin the season. By also possessing adept attacking midfielders in Shinji Kagawa and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Tuchel was able to utilize their creative abilities to open up pockets of space between the lines, where forwards and late runners from midfield would often sprint into, to score the team’s goals. However, Tuchel’s debut season at Borussia Dortmund ended trophyless, despite an appearance in the 2016 DFB-Pokal Final, in which they lost to Bayern Munich on penalties. The team also suffered elimination at the quarter-final stage of the UEFA Europa League at the hands of Liverpool, who were now coached by Klopp. The campaign was also notable for further promotions of youth talent, with American teenager Christian Pulisic largely starring for the team during the latter stages of the season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Born in Krumbach, Tuchel’s playing career ended at age 25, as a result of a chronic knee cartilage injury, and in 2000, he began his coaching career, working for the youth teams at VfB Stuttgart for five years. In 2009, following a successful one-year period at FC Augsburg II, he was hired by newly promoted Bundesliga club Mainz 05.</p><p>Tuchel’s time as the coach of Augsburg II later impressed many top-level German clubs, and he moved to Bundesliga club Mainz 05 in 2009 taking over the reins from Jürgen Klopp who left Mainz for Borussia Dortmund. Tuchel, being promoted into the position after acting as a youth coach at Mainz for the previous 12 months, signed an initial two-year contract.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Thomas Tuchel height</b> <strong>6 ft 3 in</strong> Thomas <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>He featured in only eight games in 1992–93 season, with largely unimpressive performances, and following an even more disappointing 1993–94 season, he was dropped from Kickers first team, and quickly joined third-tier Regionalliga Süd side, SSV Ulm, becoming a mainstay for the club over his four-year spell, featuring in 69 matches as an imposing central defender. Despite this, he was forced to end his active career in 1998, at age 25, after suffering a chronic knee cartilage injury earlier that year.</p><p align=justify>Tuchel’s first match in charge also yielded his first honor at the club, as PSG defeated Monaco 4–0 to win the Trophée des Champions on August 4. He also saw victory in his first league game, as the club defeated Caen 3–0 eight days later. After enjoying a brief unbeaten record, Tuchel suffered his first defeat at PSG on September 18, losing 3–2 away to Liverpool in a UEFA Champions League group game. However, by November, Tuchel would break the record for the most wins to start to a domestic league season, as he registered twelve straight victories. The record was later extended to include two additional victories, prior to the club ending its 100% start to the season on 2 December, after PSG drew 2–2 away to Bordeaux. Tuchel then guided PSG to top spot in the club’s UEFA Champions League group, with a 4–1 away win over Red Star Belgrade on December 12. By securing victory over Nantes on December 22, Tuchel also broke the record for most points by Christmas in Ligue 1, with 47 after 17 games eclipsing the record of 45 after 17 set by PSG in the 2015–16 season.</p><h2>Who is Thomas Tuchel Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Thomas Tuchel</strong> married to <strong>Sissi Tuchel </strong>.

Both players allowed him to address major squad deficiencies from the previous season, where Mainz often saw an inability to break down defensively-minded teams, while also having limited attacking success from the left-flank. This allowed the club to enjoy a perfect start to the season, enjoying seven wins in their first seven games, including an away victory over Bayern Munich. Tuchel eventually led the team to a fifth-placed finish, with Fuchs and Holtby contributing with eight league-assists, as the club improved by a total of 11 points to qualify for the third-qualifying round in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League.</p><h2>Top Facts about Thomas Tuchel</h2><li>Thomas Tuchel was born on August 29, 1973 in Krumbach, West Germany.</li><li>He played as a defender for SSV Ulm and Stuttgarter Kickers.</li><li>Tuchel’s coaching career began at VfB Stuttgart II in 2000.</li><li>He led Borussia Dortmund to the DFB-Pokal title in 2017.</li><li>Tuchel became Paris Saint-Germain manager in May 2018.</li><li>In his first season with PSG, he won the Ligue 1 title.</li><li>Tuchel was appointed Chelsea manager in January 2021.</li><li>He won the UEFA Champions League with Chelsea in May 2021.</li><li>Tuchel is known for his tactical flexibility and attention to detail.</li><li>He has been praised for his ability to develop young players.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Thomas Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Soccer Coach</strong>.

Tuchel, however, was able to replace them with addition of forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, while also changing goalkeeper, a problem position for the club, with the promotion of Loris Karius. Tuchel also worked extensively with midfield youth product Yunus Mallı, who became capable of playing multiple roles within the midfield, as well being able to operate as a second-striker or center-forward. This allowed the team to transition into a more defensively cohesive and purposeful unit from the purely press-based mindset seen previously, with play now consistently running through the partnership exhibited by Mallı and Choupo-Moting. Tuchel was also able to transition the side into being able to play from the back, due to Karius’ passing and distributing abilities. After a strong finish to the season, Tuchel extended his contract to remain with the club for another two seasons.</p><h3>Has Thomas Tuchel ever won a final?</h3><p><b>Having secured his first and only major title – the 2016/17 DFB Cup – in his final game in charge</b>, Thomas Tuchel’s tenure as Borussia Dortmund coach came to an end.</p><h3>Where is Thomas Tuchel from?</h3><p>Krumbach, Germany</p><h3>What team did Thomas Tuchel play for?</h3><table><tr>Personal information</tr><tr><td>2007–2008</td><td>FC Augsburg II</td></tr><tr><td>2009–2014</td><td>Mainz 05</td></tr><tr><td>2015–2017</td><td>Borussia Dortmund</td></tr><tr><td>2018–2020</td><td><b>Paris Saint-Germain</b></td></tr></table><h3>How many final has Tuchel lost?</h3><p>Including one-off games such as the DFL-Supercup, Trophee des Champions and UEFA Super Cup, Tuchel has taken charge of 14 finals.
