Randy Bullock (born December 16, 1989) is an American football placekicker for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Texas A&M, and was recognized as the nation’s best college football kicker and a consensus All-American. He was selected by the Houston Texans in the fifth round of the 2012 NFL Draft, after winning college football’s Lou Groza Award. Bullock is currently the 27th most accurate placekicker in NFL history.</p><p>Nearly 20% of his field goal attempts as a member of the Texans were 50+ yards, well above the NFL average, as the Texans struggled on offense from 2013 to 2015, often failing to reach the red zone.</p><p>In the game against the San Diego Chargers during Week 1 of the 2013 regular season, Bullock hit the game-winning field goal from 41 yards to cap the biggest comeback in Texans history. However, in week 2 against the Tennessee Titans, he missed three long field goals (from 50, 50, and 46 yards). In Week 9 against the Indianapolis Colts, he missed three field goals, including a 55-yard attempt in the final seconds of the game; the Texans lost by a score of 27–24.</p><p>Bullock fully recovered from his injury, without losing leg strength, and won the kicking job the following season. During the 2013 preseason, Bullock hit 6 of 7 field goal attempts, including one from 55 yards.</p><p align=justify>The Houston Texans selected Bullock in the fifth round of the 2012 NFL Draft, with the 161st overall pick, becoming the first kicker ever drafted by the team. His draft profiles agreed that he has tremendous leg strength for field goals and kickoffs, along with his accuracy on long and short kicks. NFL draft analysts noted that Bullock takes a consistent, controlled approach to each kick, getting enough rise to avoid blocks.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Randy Bullock</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Randy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Randy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1989</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Klein, Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Klein, Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Randy Bullock ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
