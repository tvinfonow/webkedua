He rose to fame as a member of the boy band One Direction after beginning his career as an actor, appearing as an extra in ITV drama film If I Had You and the BBC drama Waterloo Road. In 2010, he auditioned as a solo contestant on the British music competition series The X Factor. He was eliminated as a solo performer before he was put into a group with four other contestants, forming One Direction. The band has released five albums, embarked on four world tours, and won nearly 200 awards.</p><p>In 2010, Tomlinson auditioned for the seventh series of the singing competition The X Factor. He failed to progress to the “Boys” category at judges’ houses but, after a suggestion from guest judge Nicole Scherzinger during the bootcamp stage of the competition at Wembley Arena, London, in July 2010, he was put together with Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Harry Styles to form a five-piece boy band, thus qualifying for the “Groups” category. Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practise. Styles came up with the name One Direction. For their qualifying song at judges’ houses and their first song as a group One Direction sang an acoustic version of “Torn” by Natalie Imbruglia. Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group “were confident, fun, like a gang of friends and kind of fearless as well.” Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell’s last act in the competition. The group quickly gained popularity in the UK. One Direction finished in third place and immediately after the final their song “Forever Young”, which would have been released if they had won The X Factor, was leaked onto the internet.</p><p align=justify>He is the son&nbsp;He is the son of <a href=#>Johannah Poulston</a> and Troy Austin.
