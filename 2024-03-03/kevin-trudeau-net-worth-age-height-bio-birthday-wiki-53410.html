American author, radio personality, and infomercial salesman who promoted various health and diet regimens. He was given a 10-year prison sentence in 2014.</p><p>He was challenged by reporter <a href=#>Jake Tapper</a> on Nightline over his various unsubstantiated claims.</p><p>The back cover includes the following quote from Dr. Herbert Ley, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who died three years before the book was written: “The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It isn’t. What the FDA is doing and what people think it’s doing are as different as night and day.” The statement, extracted from a 1969 interview in The New York Times, was made in the context of Ley’s resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes. Trudeau’s lawyer, David J. Bradford, says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by Ley, but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book.</p><p>Trudeau used research that Dr. Michael Van Masters conducted with the State School for the Blind in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1975 as the basis of the Mega Memory products. Trudeau was selling automobiles at Neponset Lincoln Mercury in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston in 1982 when he first met Van Masters.
