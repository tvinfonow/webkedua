His role as Christoffer earned him the Zulu Award for Best Actor and Bodil and Robert Festival nominations for Best Actor. Eddie Cockrell of Variety noted his “rigid countenance” in an “outstanding” performance. The same year, Mikkelsen achieved his first widely acclaimed international success as Le Chiffre in the twenty-first James Bond film, Casino Royale. Mikkelsen has said that he so easily won the part that even Daniel Craig asked him if he had slept with someone in order to be cast. He said of the casting, “They’d done their homework, seen my stuff, so it was fine, just a bit of anti-climax, because I was so ready to do more for them, but it was … shrugs… you’re in.” He also stated that because he was already a big film star in Denmark at the time, that the international role did not really change much. Roger Ebert noted the suspense during Mikkelsen’s scene with Bond during the extended poker game, in which Le Chiffre weeps blood from his left eye. David Edelstein of New York Magazine said “Mikkelsen clicks his rectangular plaques as if he’s a new breed of praying mantis. He’s bloodcurdling.” In 2006, Mikkelsen also took the lead role in the Danish drama After the Wedding, which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film. He won the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a European Film Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance. The New York Times remarked that on the Hollywood scene, Mikkelsen has “become a reliable character actor with an intriguing mug” but stated that on the domestic front “he is something else: a star, an axiom, a face of the resurgent Danish cinema.”</p><h2>Who is Mads Mikkelsen Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mads Mikkelsen</strong> married to <strong>Hanne Jacobsen </strong>.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in Denmark</strong>. Mads Mikkelsen celebrates birthday on November 22 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In 2008, Mikkelsen portrayed Danish resistance fighter Jørgen Haagen Schmith opposite Thure Lindhardt and Stine Stengade in Ole Christian Madsen’s Flame & Citron (Flammen & Citronen), a film which is loosely based on actual events involving two of the most active fighters in the Holger Danske resistance group during World War II. Mikkelsen’s character nicknamed “Citronen” is named after a Citroën factory in which he works. Michael O’ Sullivan of The Washington Post likened Mikkelsen and Lindhardt’s characters to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and said that it is “the story of handsome rogues with guns. It’s fast-paced, stylish and thrilling.” In 2008, Mikkelsen also provided the voice for the character Le Chiffre in the Quantum of Solace video game, and he represented Le Chiffre when he was invited to the launch of Swiss watchmaker Swatch’s “007 Villain Collection” in Bregenz, Austria. The following year, gaining a reputation as one of Europe’s most sensuous male actors, Mikkelsen played a hot-blooded Stravinsky opposite Anna Mouglalis in Jan Kounen’s critically acclaimed Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky based on the romance between the composer and the fashion designer. Empire magazine described it as a “visually stunning film [which] focuses on Chanel and Stravinsky’s illicit relationship in 1920s France.” Philip French of The Observer described the film as a “beautiful, intelligent, shallow film, like a pane of plate glass that at first glance looks like a deep lake”, and remarked that Mikkelsen’s Stravinsky matched Mouglalis’s Coco Chanel as a “fellow modernist and equally cool egotist.” Mikkelsen then returned to violent action, collaborating once again with Refn, playing a Norse warrior in the Crusades in Valhalla Rising (2009) and Draco, a self-sacrificing leader of the king’s guard in Clash of the Titans (2010). Valhalla Rising was shot entirely in Scotland.</p><h3>Why did they replace Johnny Depp in Fantastic Beasts?</h3><p>Mikkelsen was tapped to replace Depp in the role of dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald after <b>Depp lost a high-profile libel suit against Britain’s The Sun tabloid newspaper in 2020</b>.</p><h3>How many languages does Mads Mikkelsen speak?</h3><p>Languages</p><h3>Are Lars and Mads Mikkelsen related?</h3><p><b>Older brother</b> of Mads Mikkelsen.
