Kenneth Earl Davis (born April 16, 1962) is a former professional American football running back who played for the NFL’s Green Bay Packers from 1986–1988 and the Buffalo Bills from 1989–1994.</p><p>As a rookie, he was the team’s leading rusher with 519 yards, returned 12 kickoffs for 231 yards, and caught 21 passes for 142 yards. In 1987, he was their leading rusher again, although he only rushed for 413 yards. Davis played only 9 games with the Packers in 1988 due to injuries, and signed with the Bills after the season ended.</p><p>In 1992, Davis had the best season of his career. He rushed for 613 yards, caught 15 passes for 80 yards, returned 14 kickoffs for 251 yards, and scored a career-high 6 touchdowns. But he is best remembered for his superb performance in the post season. In Buffalo’s wild card game against the Houston Oilers, Thomas was knocked out of the game early with a hip injury, and Houston built up a 28–3 first half lead. Then, they increased it to 35–3 early in the third quarter when backup quarterback Frank Reich’s pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown. But in what became known as The Comeback, Buffalo stormed back and won the game 41–38 in overtime; the rally from the 32-point deficit was the largest comeback in NFL history. Davis was instrumental in the Bills victory, rushing for 68 yards, catching 2 passes for 25 yards, and scoring the first touchdown of the game for Buffalo. One week later, the Bills traveled on the road to face the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional Playoffs, with Thomas back but playing hurt, Davis did a superb job carrying the offense, rushing for 104 yards and a touchdown on just 10 carries in the Bills 24–3 win. Then the Bills advanced to their 3rd consecutive Super Bowl by defeating the Miami Dolphins 29–10 in the AFC title game. Thomas had recovered enough to regain his spot on the starting lineup, but Davis was still a major factor in Buffalo’s victory. He rushed for 61 yards and a touchdown while also catching 4 passes for 52 yards. The Bills lost Super Bowl XXVII 52–17, but Davis had a great game. He was the Bills leading rusher with 86 yards, while also catching 3 passes for 16 yards and returning a kickoff for 21 yards.</p><p>Davis was major contributor for Buffalo for the 1993 season as the team advanced to their 4th consecutive Super Bowl. He rushed for 391 yards, caught 21 passes for 95 yards, and gained 100 yards on kickoff returns. After his team lost Super Bowl XXVIII to the Dallas Cowboys 30–13, he spent one more season with Buffalo and then retired in 1995.</p><p align=justify>Considered a potential first-round draft pick in the 1986 NFL Draft by Mel Kiper and Gil Brandt, Davis decided to join the NFL one year early after his suspension from TCU. However, he was denied as he had already played one game that year; under the “Red Grange Rule”, players are not allowed to play college and NFL football in the same year. In an attempt to force the NFL to allow a special supplemental draft, Davis and agent Michael Trope prepared to sue the league for $13 million; Trope pointed to Florida State running back Roosevelt Snipes, who was kicked off the FSU roster before the 1985 season and was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the supplemental draft, as an exception to the rule.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kenneth Davis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kenneth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kenneth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Temple</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Temple</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kenneth Davis ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kenneth Davis</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Before his NFL career, Davis played for Texas Christian University from 1982–1985. As a junior, he rushed for 1,611 yards (#3 in the NCAA) and 16 touchdowns, earning him a first team selection on the College Football All-America Team. He also had the 5th most votes of all candidates for the Heisman Trophy that year. His 1,611 rushing yards were a school record, and remained so until LaDainian Tomlinson rushed for 1,850 yards in 1999.</p><p align=justify>NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle rejected Davis again and the league filed a counter-suit to ensure the Grange Rule was legal. Davis accepted the ruling and tried to drop the case, but attorney Steven Knowles filed the suit anyway, unaware of Davis’ decision. After the matter was cleared, Davis waited until 1986 to enter the league, and he was selected by the Packers in the second round of the 1986 NFL Draft.</p><p align=justify>With the Bills, Davis proved to be a superb complement to star running back Thurman Thomas, and a great asset to the team overall. In 1990, he rushed for 302 yards on just 64 carries (a 4.7 yards per carry average), caught 9 passes for 78 yards, and scored 5 touchdowns, assisting his team to Super Bowl XXV, where they lost to the New York Giants. In the game, Davis rushed for 4 yards and caught 2 passes for 23 yards. The following season, he rushed for 624 yards, caught 20 passes for 118 yards, returned 4 kickoffs for 73 yards, and assisted Buffalo to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. They lost Super Bowl XXVI to the Washington Redskins 37–24, but Davis had a good performance, leading the team with 17 rushing yards and catching 4 passes for 38 yards. He would get the start in that game, because star running back Thurman Thomas could not find his helmet.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kenneth Davis height</b> Not available right now.
