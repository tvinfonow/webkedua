He was one of the most-wanted Mexican drug lords.</p><p>He served in the Army for seven years and eventually deserted on 27 March 1998, when he was recruited by Osiel Cárdenas Guillén and Arturo Guzmán Decena to form part of Los Zetas, originally set up by former soldiers of the Mexican Army working on the behalf of the Gulf Cartel. After Cárdenas Guillén was arrested and extradited to the United States in 2007, Los Zetas broke relations with the Gulf Cartel in 2010 and rose to become the strongest criminal organization in Mexico, alongside the Sinaloa Cartel. Lazcano was placed as third in command (Z-3), and after the death of Guzmán Decena (Z-1) in 2002 and the capture of Rogelio González Pizaña (Z-2) in 2004, he became the commander.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hugo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Viart</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drug Lord</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Apan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hidalgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mexico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gregorio Lazcano, Amelia Lazcano Pérez</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mireya Lazcano Lazcano</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Erick Heriberto Lazcano</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

During his tenure in the Mexican Army, Lazcano reportedly received military training from the Israeli Defense Forces and the United States Army, but eventually deserted in 1998, after eight years of service. Upon his desertion, he was recruited by the drug lord Osiel Cárdenas Guillén and Arturo Guzmán Decena with around 30 other soldiers to work as the enforcers of the Gulf Cartel, forming the paramilitary group known as Los Zetas. His torture methods earned him the nickname “El Verdugo” (‘The Executioner’), particularly for killing his victims by feeding them to lions and tigers he kept in a ranch.</p><h2>Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano is one of the <strong>richest Drug Lord</strong> from Mexico. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Lazcano was born to a poor family on Christmas Day, December 1974, in Apan, Hidalgo, Mexico. He enlisted in the Mexican Army as an infantry soldier at age 17 and was later enrolled in the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), an elite special forces team dedicated to combating Guerrillas (like the EZLN) and drug-trafficking organizations. His first military mission took place during the presidency of Ernesto Zedillo, when he was sent along with other GAFE soldiers to put down the armed insurgency in Chiapas. After that, he was moved to northern Mexico as part of a security reinforcement program against the drug trafficking organizations. While serving in the Mexican Army, Lazcano reportedly received training from the Israeli Defense Forces and the United States Army. He acquired training in areas of counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism tactics; sniper techniques; jungle, mountain, desert, naval, and urban warfare; and learned how to use explosives, high-calibre rifles and grenade-launchers.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drug Lord</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Lazcano is suspected of killing hundreds of people, including the journalist Francisco Ortiz Franco, who was assassinated in 2004 in front of his two children as he was leaving a clinic. Lazcano played a particular role in Los Zetas; with his military training, he was able to combine “military precision with stone-hearted criminality.” When he was in power, Lazcano would go with his organization into several regions of Mexico, find out who was in charge of the local kidnapping, human trafficking, and extortion rings, and kill them to take over their business. The rest were then told to join or die.</p><p>Lazcano was the most powerful cartel leader to be killed since the start of Mexico’s drug war in 2006.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano height</b> <strong>1.80 m (5 ft 11 in)</strong> Hugo <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1.80 m (5 ft 11 in)</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While traveling through Reynosa, Tamaulipas on 18 February 1998, Lazcano was detained by the Mexican authorities with 325 kilograms of marijuana in his car (Chevrolet Silverado). During that time, Lazcano was still working as a judicial police officer in Tamaulipas but was also working for the drug lord Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. The federal document does not explain why he was allowed to leave after the narcotics were confiscated, but soon after this incident Lazcano left the military and his duty as a police reinforcement to work full-time for the Gulf Cartel.</p><p align=justify>By 2008, Lazcano forged an alliance with the brothers of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel and with Vicente Carrillo Fuentes of the Juárez Cartel. Since early 2010, Los Zetas broke relations with their former employers, the Gulf Cartel, causing a violent turf war throughout the border states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León in northeastern Mexico. The war between these two criminal organizations has left thousands dead.</p><h2>Who is Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

You may help us to build the dating records for Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano!<p>In addition, the power struggle of Los Zetas and Lazcano’s absence will probably hurt the Juárez Cartel in its fight against Sinaloa Cartel for the control of the smuggling routes in the state of Chihuahua. Given the organization’s fragmentation, the Zetas will probably not be able to support Vicente Carrillo Fuentes in Ciudad Juárez, which will allow them to fall prey to their competitors in the area. The infamous border town of Ciudad Juárez, which experienced more than 11,000 homicides from 2007 to 2012 and an average of 300 homicides a month in 2010, will probably remain calm. After violence reached its peak in October 2010, homicides have plummeted steadily in the city, mainly because the Sinaloa Cartel has managed to defeat the Juárez Cartel and its affiliated gangs. By late 2012, Ciudad Juárez “entered a new chapter” in Mexico’s criminal underworld; Julián Leyzaola, the city’s police chief, controlled the police forces; social programs like Todos Somos Juárez were implemented throughout the city; and, “perhaps the best indicator of a peaceful future,” the Sinaloa Cartel managed to take control of the smuggling routes in the city as a full-pledged one-tier organization. According to the journalist Samuel Logan, Ciudad Juárez is likely to experience relative peace in the future as the Sinaloa Cartel fights off the remaining second-tier groups to establish a monopoly in the area.</p><h2>Top Facts about Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano</h2><li>Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano was a Mexican drug lord.</li><li>He was the leader of the Los Zetas cartel.</li><li>He was known as “El Lazca” or “Z-3”.</li><li>He was born on December 25, 1974, in Apan, Hidalgo, Mexico.</li><li>He started his criminal career as a member of the Gulf Cartel.</li><li>In 2007, he split from the Gulf Cartel and formed Los Zetas.</li><li>The US government offered a $5 million reward for his capture.</li><li>He was killed by Mexican marines in October 2012.</li><li>His death led to infighting within Los Zetas and weakened the cartel’s power.</li><li>His legacy includes brutal violence and control over drug trafficking routes.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Hugo Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Drug Lord</strong>.

Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano celebrates birthday on December 25 of every year.</p><p align=justify>On a wall of the chapel in the village of Tezontle, Hidalgo, a plaque says it was donated by Heriberto Lazcano: “Donated by Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, Lord, hear my prayer”, reads the bronze-colored marker, which states the chapel was built in honor of Pope John Paul II. The Rev. Juan Aguilar, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tulancingo, where the chapel is located, said it was built in 2009 as a community project and the money did not go through the church, which was unaware of who funded it. The revelation has the church distancing itself from the property while admitting it knows of other donations from drug traffickers. The federal Attorney General is investigating the funding of the Tezontle chapel for possible criminal charges, including money laundering or “use of illicit funds.” The diocese will decide whether to continue using the chapel, depending on the results of the federal investigation.</p><h3>¿Quién es el Z 3?</h3><p>Lazcano (Z-3) según reportes de la PGR, era tercero en el orden de mando.
