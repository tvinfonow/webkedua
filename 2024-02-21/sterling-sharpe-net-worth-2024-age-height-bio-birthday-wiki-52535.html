In his rookie season, he started all sixteen games and caught 55 passes. His sophomore season he led the league with 90 receptions, the first Packer to do so since Don Hutson in 1945, and broke Hutson’s records for receptions and receiving yards in a season. Sharpe was known as a tough receiver with strong hands, who was willing to go over the middle to make difficult catches in traffic.</p><p>Sterling’s tenure at wide receiver was cut short by the neck injury, ending a career in which he was invited to the Pro Bowl five times (1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1994). Since he was unable to continue playing and was not on the Packers team that won the Super Bowl in 1996, his younger brother Shannon Sharpe gave him the first of the three Super Bowl rings he won, citing him as a major influence in his life by saying:</p><p align=justify>His younger brother,&nbsp;His brother, <a href=#>Shannon Sharpe</a>, was a three-time Super Bowl-winning tight end.&nbsp;was a three-time super Bowl-winning tight end.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sterling Sharpe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sterling</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sharpe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chicago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Shannon Sharpe</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sterling Sharpe ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In the final game of that season, Sterling and Favre hooked up for Shape’s 107th reception of the season which broke the NFL’s single-season receptions record, set by Art Monk in 1984. That season, Sterling became one of only six players in NFL history to win the outright “Triple Crown” at the receiver position: leading the league in receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and receptions. Ray Flaherty (1932), Don Hutson (1936, 1941–44), Elroy Hirsch (1951), Raymond Berry (1959) led all three categories during the same season in years before the Super Bowl era. Jerry Rice (1990) and Steve Smith Sr. (2005) are the only other players to accomplish this feat since the first Super Bowl season. In the 1993 season Sterling subsequently broke his own record, with 112 receptions; this also made him the first player to have consecutive seasons catching more than 100 passes. In 1994, his 18 touchdown receptions were the second-most in league history at the time, behind Jerry Rice’s 22 in 1987. On October 24, 1993, Sterling became the second Packer in team history to catch four touchdown passes in one game since Don Hutson in 1945.</p><h2>Sterling Sharpe Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Sterling Sharpe is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States.
