Harrington’s parents, John and Valerie Harrington, run the foundation.</p><p>Harrington’s career in Detroit was largely unsuccessful. Front office mismanagement, woeful offensive line protection, lack of talent at other skill positions, and an erratic philosophical change in the team’s identity to a conservative West Coast Offense (WCO) oriented attack under Head Coach Steve Mariucci may have played a factor in Harrington not realizing his potential professionally. Harrington’s best season as a Lion came in 2004, when he threw for 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. The Lions started the season with a 4–2 record, but Harrington led the team to only two more wins the rest of the season. The Lions finished 6–10 and missed the playoffs for the fifth season in a row.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Joey Harrington height</b> <strong>6 ft 4 in</strong> Joey <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 4 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Harrington was selected by the Detroit Lions with the third pick overall in the 2002 NFL Draft. Harrington took over for incumbent Mike McMahon late in the Lions’ Week 1 loss against the Miami Dolphins and became the Lions’ starting quarterback shortly thereafter, finishing that year with a 50.1 completion percentage, a ratio of 12 touchdowns to 16 interceptions, and a 59.9 quarterback rating; the Lions finished the season with a 3–13 record. He was named the 2002 recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Rookie of the Year Award.</p><p align=justify>In 2005, NFL analyst and Hall Of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman wrote that Harrington “can still be a really good quarterback in this league,” and does not deserve the blame for what happened in Detroit: “The focus on Joey’s play has given every other player a hall pass, and that’s not right.”</p><h2>Who is Joey Harrington Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Joey Harrington</strong> married to <strong>Emily Hatten </strong>.

The Lions won 13–10, and Garcia rushed for Detroit’s only touchdown. After yet another dismal offensive performance, Mariucci declared that Garcia would remain the starter. That marked the first time since the 2002 season that Harrington did not appear in a Lions’ game, breaking a string of 37 consecutive appearances. Harrington regained the starting role the week after Garcia threw a game-ending interception returned for a touchdown in overtime against Chicago. Harrington started again for Detroit on November 13, 2005, against the Arizona Cardinals, throwing for three touchdowns without an interception in the Lions’ 29–21 win. Harrington was voted by Lions fans as their Offensive Player of the Year, according to the Lions’ official website. Despite his difficult times in Detroit, he remained unwaveringly optimistic and was thus dubbed “Joey Blue-Skies” and “Joey Sunshine” by sarcastic Lions’ fans and beat writers who grew tired of his predictable post-game commentary as the losses continued to mount.</p><h3>What happened Joey Harrington?</h3><p>Regrettably, he never reached the potential the Lions thought he had when they drafted him in 2002. <b>Detroit ultimately traded Harrington to the Miami Dolphins for a sixth-round draft choice on May 12, 2006</b>.
