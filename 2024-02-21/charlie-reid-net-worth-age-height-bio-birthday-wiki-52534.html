The demo fell into the hands of English indie pop band the Housemartins, who invited the Proclaimers to support them on their 1986 tour. First opening at the Hummingbird in Birmingham, the tour afforded the duo the opportunity to perform on Channel 4 pop programme The Tube in January 1987, and Chrysalis Records quickly signed the pair.</p><p>In 1987, the duo John Williams-produced debut record This Is the Story was released through Chrysalis, and displayed a minimalist sound lauded by Timothy Monger as “sparse but spirited”. For release as a single, the album-track “Letter from America” was remixed by Gerry Rafferty, embellishing the song with a full-band sound. The single peaked at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, as the duo appeared on Top of the Pops for the first time on 12 December 1987, while the album This Is the Story went gold. On their 1987 breakthrough, Neil McCormick of The Telegraph opined that the pair “stuck out like a pair of sore thumbs” amidst the “ersatz glamour of Eighties pop”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Charlie Reid height</b> Not available right now.

In allusion to the their early sound, actor Peter Mullan said that the Proclaimers played “a mix of post-punk and folk”. During this time, the duo attracted a regional fan-base, with Inverness having an especially dedicated community of supporters. Many of the duo’s songs, such as “Letter from America” which was written in 1984 and reflected unemployment rates of the day, were conceived in this period.</p><p align=justify>The follow-up album, Sunshine on Leith, was released in 1988 and featured a rock-driven sound as the Proclaimers worked with a band for the first time. Ranging in lyrical-themes from familial joy to Scottish nationalism, the record featured the singles “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)”, which went to number one in Australia and New Zealand, and “I’m On My Way”. The album was a particularly big hit in Australia in 1989, being that year’s 12th biggest-seller, reaching No. 2, and attaining a 2× multi-platinum certification by the ARIA. Craig Reid described this success as their “biggest ever”. Attaining certifications of 2× multi-platinum in Canada, at the time of June 2009 Sunshine on Leith had sold a worldwide total of 2 million copies.
