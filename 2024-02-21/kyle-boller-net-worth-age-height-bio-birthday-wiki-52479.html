He earned the 1998 California State Player of the Year honors after an outstanding senior season at William S. Hart High School in Santa Clarita, CA. He led Hart to the CIF Southern Section Division III title with a 13–1 record. He passed for California prep record of 4,838 yards and threw for 59 touchdowns, the 2nd-best mark in California prep history, and ended the season completing 290 of 454 passes (63.9%). Because of this, he was considered by many to be the best prospect to emerge from The Valley Region of Los Angeles since John Elway came out of Granada Hills High School in 1979. During the 1998 season, Boller also played the position of safety on defense, and intercepted a pass in the final minute of the sectional championship game. He was rated the number one quarterback prospect in the nation by PrepStar and was that publication’s national Offensive Co-Player of the Year.</p><p>Boller became the Ravens’ first round draft pick in 2003 NFL Draft (19th overall pick). He was the second quarterback selected from the Pac-10 conference after the Cincinnati Bengals selected Carson Palmer from USC with the first overall pick. He started the first 9 games of the season, going 5–3, before being injured (thigh) in a game against the St. Louis Rams. He was inactive for most of the rest of the season, being replaced by backup Anthony Wright, as he also had to have surgery to repair a muscle in his quadriceps. Boller rushed 30 times for 62 yards, and completed 116 of 224 passes for 1,260 yards with 7 touchdowns and 9 interceptions.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kyle Boller</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lars</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Termansen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Quarterback</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Burbank</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Karen Boller, Bob Boller</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Candace Boller</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Carrie Prejean</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brody Boller</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kyle Boller ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kyle Boller</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Kyle Bryan Boller (born June 17, 1981) is a former American football quarterback. After playing college football for California, he was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round (19th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played for the Ravens from 2003 to 2008, the St. Louis Rams in 2009, and the Oakland Raiders from 2010 to 2011.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Quarterback</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Steve McNair, former Tennessee Titans QB, was traded to Baltimore in 2006. Coach Brian Billick declared McNair the starter instead of having the two compete for the job, citing McNair’s credentials, including 2003 NFL Co-MVP, and Boller’s propensity to turn over the ball. In Week 6 of the 2006 NFL season, McNair was sacked by Carolina Panthers defenders Mike Rucker and Chris Draft. The result of that play was a mild concussion and a neck injury. McNair left the game and would not return. Boller came in to replace him in the final seconds of the first quarter, and completed 17 of 31 passes for a 58% completion percentage, 3 touchdowns, 226 yards, and one interception. Faced with a 9-point deficit with 5:10 remaining, Boller connected with Mark Clayton for a 62-yard touchdown pass to start a comeback attempt. When the Ravens defense gave up their second touchdown of the day, Boller was called upon to score again. This time, he faced 68 yards and was given 4:08 to score a touchdown, to still be behind in the game. He drove down the field and capped off his drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Todd Heap. The Panthers were then able to run out the clock before the Raven’s offense could get back on the field, and Baltimore lost 23 – 21. Then, after McNair’s throwing hand was stepped on against Cleveland on Dec 17, Boller led the Ravens to victory with a 13-of-21, 238-yard and two-touchdown performance (112.3 passer rating), one touchdown being the game highlight, when he connected with explosive rookie receiver Demetrius Williams for the 77 yard score. That victory clinched a playoff berth for the Ravens, who had already all but locked up their division. With McNair as the starting quarterback the Ravens improved to a franchise best mark of 13–3 on the season, as compared to only going 6–10 the previous year with Boller at the helm.</p><p>The 2007 Ravens ended their season with a record of 5–11, which led to the firing of head coach Brian Billick and the drafting of future quarterback Joe Flacco.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kyle Boller height</b> <strong>6′ 3″</strong> Lars <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6′ 3″</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Boller started all 16 games the only time in his career in 2004.

He had 4 games with QB ratings over 100, including a career-high 112.3 rating while going 18-of-34 for 219 yards, with a career-high four touchdowns and no interceptions against the Giants.</p><p align=justify>After McNair was injured in the first game of the 2007 season against the Cincinnati Bengals, Boller was given the opportunity to start. He came in late in the game and was unable to pull out a victory. Boller was then named the interim starter in Week 2, in a home game against the New York Jets. He had a strong showing, throwing two touchdowns and no interceptions for 185 yds and a QB rating of 97.9. In Week 3, McNair retook the reins of the team, facing the Arizona Cardinals. The team was up in the 4th, and they switched Boller in to rest McNair, and in spite of a late comeback effort by Kurt Warner, Boller managed to get the team in position for a game-winning field goal. The following 2 games Boller was back on the bench. In weeks 6 and 7, Boller was once again named the interim starter for the Ravens.</p><h2>Who is Kyle Boller Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kyle Boller</strong> married to <strong>Carrie Prejean </strong>.
