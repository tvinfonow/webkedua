Around that same time, she joined the band Automobil and released the single “Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen”. After her stepfather Wolf Biermann’s East German citizenship was withdrawn in 1976, Hagen followed him to Hamburg. Shortly afterwards, she was offered a record deal from CBS Records and formed Nina Hagen Band. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1978 to critical acclaim and was a commercial success selling over 250,000 copies. The band released one more album, Unbehagen, before their break-up in 1979.</p><p align=justify>A European tour with a new band in 1980 was cancelled, and Hagen turned to the United States.

However, relations between Hagen and the other band members deteriorated over the course of the subsequent European tour, and Hagen decided to leave the band in 1979, though she was still under contract to produce a second album. This LP, Unbehagen (which in German also means “discomfort” or “unease”), was eventually produced with the band recording their tracks in Berlin and Hagen recording the vocals in Los Angeles. It included the single “African Reggae” and “Wir Leben Immer… Noch”, a German language cover of Lene Lovich’s “Lucky Number”.
