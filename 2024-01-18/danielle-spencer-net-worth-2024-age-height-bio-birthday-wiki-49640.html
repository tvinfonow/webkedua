Danielle Spencer (born June 24, 1965) is an American actress and former child star best known for her role as Dee Thomas on the ABC sitcom What’s Happening!!, which ran from 1976 to 1979. She would later reprise the role on the series’ sequel, What’s Happening Now!!</p><p>Spencer considers herself to be in semi-retirement from show business, but still acts occasionally. In 1997, she portrayed a veterinarian in the hit film As Good as It Gets as well as appearing in Peter Rabbit and the Crucifix in 2001. She continues to act in small roles in film and television when it does not conflict with her veterinary practice.</p><p>Spencer makes appearances as a motivational speaker. She told Ebony Magazine in 2012, “I’ve made peace with the fact that surgeries, back pain and walking with crutches will be part of my life forever. Some days are good, some days are difficult. Yet, despite the challenges, there are reasons to celebrate. My life includes volunteering with a charity that feeds the homeless; providing care for animals through my work as a vet.</p><p>Spencer was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2014. Speaking out for Breast Cancer Awareness month, Spencer told BlackAmericaWeb that her diagnosis took her by surprise. “With everything that I’ve been through with the spinal cord injury, I said I know God is not going to give me another affliction,” she said, “so I was completely shocked when the doctors told me.” Though the news came as a surprise, Spencer said the disease runs in her family. “I have a lot of help and support around me,” she said. As of the interview’s publish date in October 2014, Spencer stated she was considering her treatment options, with surgery at the top of the list. “I’m trying to get as many opinions as possible but it does look like that is what I’m going to do,” she said. “Hopefully after that there won’t be any chemotherapy or radiation involved.”</p><p align=justify>After the cancellation of the show in 1979, Spencer and her mother relocated to Africa for a time. Upon her return she attended the University of California-Davis to pursue a degree in veterinary medicine, a pursuit that was encouraged by her late stepfather.

In 1985, a sequel to the show was created called What’s Happening Now!!. Spencer went on to participate in the revival of her character Dee, appearing in various episodes over the sequel’s run for three seasons while attending college.
