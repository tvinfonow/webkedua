He then used the No. 45 in the Cup Series throughout the rest of his driving career.</p><p>Petty’s death, along with 1998 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year Kenny Irwin Jr.’s in the same corner at the same track eight weeks later, led NASCAR to mandate the use of a kill switch on the steering wheel and the adoption of the Whelen Modified Tour restrictor plate for the September Cup race; the plate was abandoned after that race. These two adjustments addressed the cause of the deadly accidents, but did not address the basilar skull fractures suffered by both drivers. At Texas Motor Speedway, Truck Series driver Tony Roper died on October 14, 2000 of a similar head injury. Mandatory use of the HANS or Hutchens device (designed to prevent the rapid-deceleration head-and-neck movements associated with the injuries associated with the Petty, Irwin, Jr., and Roper deaths) was mandated by NASCAR in October 2001, months after seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt died of the same injury on the last lap of the Daytona 500 on February 18, 2001.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Adam Petty height</b> Not available right now.

He struggled early in the Busch season, but managed to qualify in his first attempt at Winston Cup during the DirecTV 500 at Texas Motor Speedway on April 2. He qualified 33rd and ran in the middle of the pack most of the day before his engine expired, forcing him to finish 40th. Adam never got to race alongside his father. Kyle failed to qualify and eventually relieved an ill Elliott Sadler, but Adam was already out of the race. Lee Petty, Adam’s great-grandfather, and 3-time NASCAR Champion, lived to see his Winston debut, but died just three days later.</p><h2>Who is Adam Petty Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Adam Petty</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
