Her debut Japanese album, Listen to My Heart, was released on March 13, 2002. The album was a breakthrough in BoA’s career, becoming an RIAJ-certified million-seller and debuted atop the Oricon, the first album by a Korean artist to do so. It was promoted with several singles: the Top 20 hit “ID; Peace B” (originally from the eponymous album), “Amazing Kiss”, “Kimochi wa Tsutawaru”, the Top 5 hit “Listen to My Heart,” and the Top 10 “Every Heart: Minna no Kimochi”.

With the release of her debut Japanese studio album, Listen to My Heart (2002), BoA became the first Korean pop star to break through in Japan following the fall of barriers that had restricted the import and export of entertainment between the countries since the end of World War II. She is the only foreign artist to have three albums sell more than one million copies in Japan and is one of only three artists to have six consecutive number-one studio albums on the Oricon charts since her debut, the others being Ayumi Hamasaki and Koda Kumi.</p><p>BoA’s second Japanese studio album, Valenti (January 2003), became her best-selling album, with over 1,249,000 copies sold. Three singles preceded its release: “Valenti,” which peaked at the number-two position on the Oricon chart, “Kiseki / No.1” and “Jewel Song / Beside You: Boku o Yobu Koe”, both which also peaked at the number-three position. In support of the album, BoA launched BoA 1st Live Tour Valenti, her first Japanese concert tour. Later that year, she released two Korean albums, Atlantis Princess and the mini-album Shine We Are!.

The album was moderately successful; it entered the Top 10 of the South Korean charts and sold around 156,000 units. Meanwhile, her Korean record label, SM Entertainment, made arrangements with Japanese label Avex Trax to launch her music career in Japan. She was forced to quit school to prepare and in early 2001, BoA released her first mini-album, Don’t Start Now; it sold around 90,000 units. After its release, she took a hiatus from the Korean music industry to focus on the Japanese market at which time she worked to solidify her skills in Japanese.</p><p align=justify>Her third Japanese studio album, Love & Honesty (January 2004) was a musical “change in direction”: it contained a rock-dance song (“Rock with You”) and “harder” R&B. Though the album failed to match Valenti in sales, it topped the Oricon chart for two weeks and became RIAJ-certified triple-platinum. In support of the album, BoA held a tour, Live Concert Tour 2004: Love & Honesty, spanning nine performances and attracted approximately 105,000 attendants.. In contrast with 1st Live Tour, which “emphasized exotic Asian design”, the Love & Honesty tour had an “outer-space, sci-fi” theme; among the props were a three-story-high space ship and the robot Asimo. Her first compilation album, Best of Soul (February 2005), however, sold over a million copies, making BoA the first non-Japanese Asian singer to have two million-selling albums in Japan.</p><h2>Who is BoA Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>BoA</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
