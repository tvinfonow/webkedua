He is known for his pseudoscientific theories involving ancient civilisations, Earth changes, stone monuments or megaliths, altered states of consciousness, ancient myths, and astronomical or astrological data from the past.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Novelist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>BBC Two’s Horizon TV series broadcast a programme, Atlantis Reborn, on 4 November 1999 that challenged the ideas presented by Hancock. It detailed one of Hancock’s claims that the arrangement of an ancient temple complex was designed to mirror astronomical features and attempted to demonstrate that the same thing could be done with perhaps equal justification using famous landmarks in New York. It also alleged that Hancock had selectively moved or ignored the locations of some of the temples to fit his own theories (see below).</p><p>In Atlantis Reborn Again, shown on 14 December 2000, Hancock and Bauval provided further rebuttals to Krupp and argued that the ancient Egyptians had made the Pyramids correlate with the three stars of Orion’s Belt. However, the documentary as a whole continued to present serious doubts about Hancock’s claims, demonstrating as an example how, by using his methods, the constellation of Leo may be ‘discovered’ among landmarks of modern Manhattan, concluding: “As long as you have enough points and you don’t need to make every point fit, you can find virtually any pattern you want.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Graham Hancock height</b> Not available right now.

Prior to 1990 his works dealt mainly with problems of economic and social development. Since 1990 his works have focused mainly on speculative connections he makes between various archaeological, historical, and cross-cultural phenomena.</p><p align=justify>In Hancock’s book Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith, co-authored with Robert Bauval, the two put forward what sociologist of religion David V. Barrett called “a version of the old Jewish-Masonic plot so beloved by ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorists.” They suggest a connection between the pillars of Solomon’s Temple and the Twin Towers, and between the Star of David and The Pentagon. A contemporary review of Talisman by David V. Barrett for The Independent pointed to a lack of originality as well as basic factual errors, concluding that it was “a mish-mash of badly-connected, half-argued theories”. In a 2008 piece for The Telegraph referencing Talisman, Damian Thompson described Hancock and Bauval as fantasists.</p><h2>Who is Graham Hancock Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Graham Hancock</strong> married to <strong>Santha Faiia</strong>.
