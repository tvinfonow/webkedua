The series begins in 1880s England and follows Jonathan Joestar (JoJo) and his adopted brother Dio Brando, who eventually tries to kill their father in order to obtain his share of inheritance. When confronted, Dio puts on an ancient mask that turns him into a vampire. JoJo then learns a breathing technique called hamon, and travels to Dio’s castle to kill him. Subsequent arcs of JoJo follow the descendants of the Joestar family, and many are set in different parts of the world. Part 3, which would become the most popular part in the series, downplays the vampire story and hamon technique and instead introduces the power of Stands, which continues in the series today. Still being serialized over 30 years later, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure has been adapted into numerous other forms of media and the manga had 100 million collected volumes in print by December 2016. Since 2011, Araki has produced JoJolion, the eighth story arc of the series, serialized in Ultra Jump magazine.</p><p>The September 2007 issue of Cell had a cover drawn by Araki with a ligase represented as one of his Stands.
