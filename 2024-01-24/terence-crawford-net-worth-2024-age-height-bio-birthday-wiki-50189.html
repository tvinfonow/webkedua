Crawford stated after the fight “I was warming up, getting used to his style in the first couple of rounds. I just wanted to test him out, I felt like I could make an adjustment with my jab, because he’s always dropping his left hand. I thought I could get him with my jab in the southpaw stance.” At the time of stoppage, Crawford was ahead 78–72,&nbsp;78–72,&nbsp;77–73&nbsp;on the judges’ scorecards.

The fight was scheduled for ten rounds and took place on the undercard of Miguel Cotto vs. Delvin Rodriguez on HBO at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida on October 5. Klimov was coming off a majority decision (MD) win over fringe contender John Molina Jr. in June 2013. Crawford outclassed and outpointed Klimov, handing him his first defeat as a professional in a UD win. After ten rounds, all three judges scored the fight 100–90 in Crawford’s favour. There was lack of action as Klimov failed to impress and go in for any offence. According to CompuBox stats, Crawford landed 192 of 604 punches (32%), whilst Klimov landed just 57 of 290 (20%). In the post-fight interview, Crawford spoke on how he went in and got the job done, “I outboxed him. It was easy all night long. I thought I was hurting him all night long. I was never in any trouble and I thought he was in trouble.” Due to Klimov’s lack of action, it prompted a member of his team to call him a ‘coward’ after round eight in the corner. Klimov began to come forward and exchange more after round nine, but had no chance of winning without a KO.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Terence Crawford height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Terence <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In front of 13,323 in attendance, the largest crowd he had drawn to date, Crawford came on strong in the final round to score a twelfth-round KO win to retain his WBO welterweight title. The fight was halted at 2 minutes and 42 seconds. Crawford used an in and out style of fighting to land his shots, and then got away before Benavidez could hit him. Towards the end of round twelve, Crawford knocked down Benavidez, who fought with an injured knee, with a left-right combination, the final punch being a right uppercut. After Benavidez got back to his feet, Crawford landed a flurry of punches until referee Celestino Ruiz stepped in. Crawford landed head and body combinations earlier in the fight which forced Benavidez to take a step back. Crawford credited the body shots, saying, “That takes something out of you every time.
