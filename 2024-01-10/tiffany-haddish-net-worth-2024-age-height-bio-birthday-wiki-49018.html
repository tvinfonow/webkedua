Writer, comedian, actress and dancer who has appeared on a variety of comedy and television shows.&nbsp;She is most well-known for being Jackie for OWN’s show If I Love You Isn’t Right, Tiffany on BET’s Real Husbands of Hollywood and Nekeisha on the NBC series The Carmichael Show.&nbsp;In 2019, she started acting as Terry for the animated show Tuca & Bertie and starred in The Kitchen that same year.</p><p>She appears alongside actor and comedian&nbsp;She stars alongside comedian and actor <a href=#>Jerrod Carmichael</a> in The Carmichael Show.&nbsp;in The Carmichael Show.</p><p>In 1988, while her family was living in Colton, California, Haddish’s mother Leola suffered severe brain damage in a car wreck. The brain damage was believed to have caused Leola’s schizophrenia; Haddish said she became a different person after the crash, becoming quick tempered, abusive, and violent. Haddish–then nine years old and the oldest of five siblings–became the primary caregiver for her family. It was around this time when Haddish discovered her gift for making people laugh, stating: “If I could make her laugh and turn her anger into some joy, I was less likely to get beat. Same thing in school: If I could make the kids laugh, they’d help me with my homework and protect me from other bullies.”</p><p>She attended George Ellery Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles and graduated from El Camino Real High School, also in Woodland Hills, where she was the school mascot. Haddish said she could not read very well until high school, but improved when she received tutoring from a teacher. She also got in a lot of trouble at school, despite her award-winning participation in drama competition featuring Shakespearean monologues. In 1997, after her social worker gave her an ultimatum to either attend psychiatric therapy or go to the Laugh Factory Comedy Camp, then seventeen-year-old Haddish opted for comedy as outlet for her pain. She has said that the mentorship from many notable comedians—including Richard Pryor, Dane Cook, Charles Fleischer, the Wayans brothers—helped her discover her passion for comedy and it “literally saved her life.” She incorporates her past real life experiences in her sets, finding that doing so functions as a sort of “safe space” for her.</p><p align=justify>She is the eldest of five siblings. she frequently cared for and raised when her mother was working.&nbsp;Her family has been Ethiopian Jewish and Eritrean.&nbsp;In 2020, she began dating rapper&nbsp;She is the oldest of five siblings, whom she often took care of and raised while her mother was at work.
