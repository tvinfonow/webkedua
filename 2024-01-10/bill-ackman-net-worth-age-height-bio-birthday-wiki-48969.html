They agreed to a “schmuck insurance”, under which, if Icahn were to sell the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but he refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.</p><p>In 2004, with $54 million from his personal funds and from his former business partner Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.

Wendy’s spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy’s investors. After a dispute over executive succession that led Ackman to sell his shares at a substantial profit, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy’s fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Bill Ackman height</b> Not available right now.
