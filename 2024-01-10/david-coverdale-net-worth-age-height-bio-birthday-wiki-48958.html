Before Whitesnake, Coverdale was the lead singer of Deep Purple from 1973 to 1976, after which he established his solo career. A collaboration with Jimmy Page resulted in a 1993 album that was certified Platinum. In 2016, Coverdale was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple, giving one of the band’s induction speeches. Coverdale is known in particular for his powerful blues-tinged voice.</p><p>In 1973 Coverdale saw an article in a copy of Melody Maker, which said that Deep Purple was auditioning for singers to replace Ian Gillan. Coverdale had fronted a local group called The Government, which had played with Deep Purple on the same bill in 1969, so he and the band were familiar with one another, and after sending a tape and later auditioning, Coverdale was admitted into the band, with bassist Glenn Hughes adding his own vocals as well.</p><p align=justify>He was married to Julia in 1974.

In April 1974 Coverdale and Deep Purple performed to over 200,000 fans on his first trip to the United States at the California Jam.</p><h2>David Coverdale Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>David Coverdale is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>David Coverdale</b>'s net worth <strong>$18 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He sang for The Government from 1968 to 1972, and for the Fabulosa Brothers from 1972 to 1973.</p><p align=justify>He is an American citizen who is a dual citizen of both the US as well as the UK.</p><p align=justify>Coverdale was born on 22 September 1951, in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Riding of Yorkshire, England son of Thomas Joseph Coverdale and Winnifred May (Roberts) Coverdale. Around the age of 14, he began performing professionally and developing his voice. “I don’t think my voice had broken,” he explained to Sounds in 1974. “And that’s when I first learnt how to sing with my stomach, which sounds silly, but it’s totally different from a normal voice.” Coverdale started performing with local bands Vintage 67 (1966–68), The Government (1968–72) and Fabulosa Brothers (1972–73).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$18 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Rather than disbanding, Coverdale was instrumental in persuading the band to continue with American guitarist Tommy Bolin (of Billy Cobham and The James Gang fame). As Jon Lord put it, “David Coverdale came up to me and said, ‘Please keep the band together.’ David played me the album that Tommy did with Billy Cobham. We liked his playing on it and invited Tommy to audition.'” The band released one studio album with Bolin, Come Taste the Band in 1975. The album was less successful than previous records, and at the end of the tour, in March 1976, Coverdale reportedly walked off in tears and handed in his resignation, to which he was told there was no band left to quit. The decision to disband Deep Purple had been made some time before the last show by Lord and Ian Paice (the last remaining original members), who had not told anyone else. The break-up was finally made public in July 1976. Said Coverdale in an interview: “I was frightened to leave the band. Purple was my life, Purple gave me my break, but all the same I wanted out.”</p><p>After the demise of Deep Purple, Coverdale embarked on a solo career. He released his first album in February 1977, titled White Snake. All songs were written by Coverdale and guitarist Micky Moody. As his first solo effort, Coverdale later admitted: “It’s very difficult to think back and talk sensibly about the first album. White Snake had been a very inward-looking, reflective and low-key affair in many ways, written and recorded as it was in the aftermath of the collapse of Deep Purple.” Even though the album was not successful, its title inspired the name of Coverdale’s future band.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>David Coverdale height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> David <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In December 1974 Burn was followed-up by Stormbringer, which also ranked at Gold album status in the US and the UK. The funk and soul influences of the previous record were even more prominent here and this was one of the reasons why guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left the band in June 1975.</p><p align=justify>In 1978 Coverdale released his second solo album Northwinds, which was received much better than the previous album. But before the album’s release, he had already formed a new band.</p><h2>Who is David Coverdale Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>David Coverdale</strong> married to <strong>Cindy Barker , Tawny Kitaen </strong>.

In early 1978, the band released the Snakebite EP, which was later repackaged as a full album (titled Snakebite, released in June 1978), with the B-side taken from Coverdale’s Northwinds album. For the follow-up album, Trouble, Coverdale was joined by his former Deep Purple colleague, keyboardist Jon Lord. For Whitesnake’s 1980 album, Ready an’ Willing, drummer Ian Paice also joined the group. Ready an’ Willing also featured the band’s biggest hit up to that point, the song “Fool for Your Loving”, which reached No. 13 on the British charts and No. 53 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Ready an’ Willing was followed up by the even more successful Come an’ Get It in 1981. During 1982 Coverdale took some time off to look after his sick daughter and decided to put Whitesnake on hold. When David Coverdale returned to music he reformed the band, which thereafter recorded the album Saints & Sinners.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>David Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rock Singer</strong>.
