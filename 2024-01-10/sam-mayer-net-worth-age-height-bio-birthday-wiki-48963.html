Mayer’s late model racing also brought him to the World Series of Asphalt, where he finished second to Stephen Nasse. Ranier also led Mayer to MDM Motorsports for a limited slate in the ARCA Racing Series and NASCAR K&N Pro Series East in the back half of 2018, with age restrictions being a factor in which races Mayer could run, as both series only let 15-year-old competitors race on certain tracks. In his first ARCA race, Mayer ran as high as third and finished inside the top-ten. After the CARS Tour season was over, Mayer was voted the series’ Most Popular Driver for 2018.
