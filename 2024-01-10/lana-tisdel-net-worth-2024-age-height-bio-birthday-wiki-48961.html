She married Josh Bachman in 2001 and lives in Kansas with their children.</p><p>A few days later, on New Year’s Eve 1993, Lotter and Nissen came to the Tisdel residence drunk and looking for Teena, and threatened the Tisdel sisters. They then drove to the house of Lisa Lambert, where Teena had been hiding out. Also in the house was Phillip Devine, a friend of theirs who was dating Tisdel’s sister Leslie. Lisa Lambert was a single mother from Pawnee City, Nebraska, who often let friends stay with her in exchange for their help and company, because she lived outside of town. Lotter and Nissen then shot Teena, Lambert, and Devine to death. Lambert’s son Tanner was in the house at the time and was unharmed. Tisdel was not present at the time of the murder, as it took place inside Lambert’s home in Humboldt, Nebraska, a 30-minute drive away from Falls City, where Tisdel lived with her mother and sister. The bodies were discovered the next day by Lambert’s mother, Anna Mae.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lana Tisdel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Laura</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Coryton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fictional Character</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Falls City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nebraska</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Linda Gutierres, Leland Tisdel</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Leslie Tisdel</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Josh Bachman</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lana Tisdel ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Teena was new to the close-knit area, from Lincoln, Nebraska, and the local crowd was curious about him. Teena and Tisdel began seeing each other, because Tisdel found Teena attractive and believed Brandon was a biological man. He was in fact born female, but identified as male. Tisdel has made it clear that her relationship with Brandon Teena was brief and did not include sex; only lasting about two months from their first meeting until the murder. However, their two-month relationship is described as very intense. Her mother Linda testified that Tisdel would be with Brandon all day, had trouble sleeping, and their relationship was all she cared about during that time.</p><h2>Lana Tisdel Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Lana Tisdel is one of the <strong>richest Fictional Character</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Lana Tisdel</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Lana M. Tisdel (born May 28, 1975) is an American woman whose early life and involvement with the December 1993 murders of Brandon Teena, Phillip DeVine and Lisa Lambert was chronicled in the 1998 documentary The Brandon Teena Story and the 1999 film Boys Don’t Cry (which left out DeVine). She was portrayed in the film by Chloë Sevigny, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Tisdel.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fictional Character</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The director of the film, Kimberly Peirce, worked on the script for many years and interviewed Lana and her mother for details on their life. Peirce also drew information from other sources including All She Wanted by Aphrodite Jones (1996), a biography of Brandon Teena and the lives of those involved with the murders; and a 1994 Village Voice piece written by Donna Minkowitz which was responsible for the story becoming a media sensation in the early 1990s.</p><p>Tisdel sued the creators of Boys Don’t Cry for using her name and likeness without permission, and the suit was settled out of court. Leslie Tisdel was vocal about the film’s script changes, and upset that her boyfriend who was murdered, Phillip Devine, was not included in the film, nor was she, and instead the film focused on Brandon Teena. There has been scrutiny that the lack of information on Phillip Devine (1974–1993), who was from Iowa, is because he was African American, and Leslie stated she believed he has been left out of the story because of racism. When Boys Don’t Cry was released, she petitioned Nebraska movie theatre owners to not show the film. Lisa Lambert’s (1969–1993) name was changed to Candace in the movie. Tisdel’s mother, Linda Gutierres, who died on December 2, 2003, at age 54, was portrayed in the film by Jeannetta Arnette.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Lana Tisdel height</b> Not available right now.

Tisdel found out he was assigned as a female after his birth name (Teena Renae Brandon) was printed in the local newspaper in the arrests section. Tisdel paid to get him out of jail, and he told her that he was undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Tisdel has disputed claims that after the truth was revealed to her, they continued a romantic relationship, but instead she told Brandon that they could still be friends. Tisdel defended Teena often, at one point lying to authorities and telling them she had seen him naked and saw his penis, in hopes they would leave him alone.</p><h2>Who is Lana Tisdel Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lana Tisdel</strong> married to <strong>Josh Bachman </strong>.
