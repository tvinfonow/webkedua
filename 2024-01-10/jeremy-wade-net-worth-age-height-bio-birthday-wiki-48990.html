Television host, who many became famous for his appearances on shows like Jungle Hooks and River Monsters.</p><p>He was in 2014’s movie Blood Lake: Attack of the Killer Lampreys in which featured&nbsp;He had a role in the 2014 film Blood Lake: Attack of the Killer Lampreys, which starred <a href=#>Shannen Doherty</a>..</p><p>In 1982, Wade made his first overseas trip, to India’s mountain rivers. Recalling this journey, Wade stated that trip was very hard going. “I took just £200 to last me three months but I managed to catch some fish such as Himalayan mahseer up to 18 pounds”. Upon his return to England, Wade wrote a couple of articles about his experiences in India for a fishing magazine. “Despite the discomfort of travelling at such a basic level, there was a real feeling of achievement and I immediately started saving money to go somewhere else. I wasn’t sure where at that point but I knew there must be other exotic fish out there, although probably not as well documented as Mahseer, but possibly even more spectacular.”</p><p>It was during another journey to India in 2005 in the Himalayan foothills that the concept for the television series River Monsters first presented itself. Upon hearing of stories from locals that some people had gone missing in the river, Wade began investigating. “Locals believed the perpetrator was a giant fish. It had the potential for a fascinating TV show–not just for people interested in fish and fishing, but for everyone.” The fish turned out to be the Goonch catfish, with Wade landing a 161-pound specimen in an epic battle for the episode. He has taken many trips to the Congo and Amazon rain forests. With the aid of local fishermen, Wade travels the world to catch various fish. Wade published his first book, Somewhere Down the Crazy River, with joint-author Paul Boote, in 1992. Wade has also written River Monsters, which details his hunts and journeys around the world.</p><p align=justify>There is a brother called Martin.&nbsp;He has not been married.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeremy Wade</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeremy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wade</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Show Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 23</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ipswich</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Queensland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Australia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jeremy Wade ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
