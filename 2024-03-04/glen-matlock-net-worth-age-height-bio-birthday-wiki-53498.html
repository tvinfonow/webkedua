Bassist for the punk band The Sex Pistols, with whom he originally worked from 1975 until 1977 and sporadically thereafter.</p><p>His departure from The Sex Pistols became the subject of many urban legends, with the real reason possibly being tension between him and vocalist Johnny Rotten that was exacerbated by the meddling of <a href=#>Malcolm McLaren</a>.</p><p>Matlock attended Saint Martin’s School of Art until 1974. He was the original bass player of the Sex Pistols, having been introduced to guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook while working in SEX, Malcolm McLaren’s clothing boutique in London. He is credited as co-writer on 10 of the 12 songs appearing on the album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols. However, his overall contribution to these songs has been disputed: Jones said in a 2011 interview he was “tired of Matlock’s claims that he had co-written some of the punk icon’s biggest tunes”, stating that he himself had written as many songs as Matlock, whilst Matlock himself notes in his book that the band only wrote two songs after his departure. According to a 2014 interview, he played a big role in writing the songs that appeared on the album and Cook has stated that Matlock wrote most of the songs appearing on the album. Additionally, whilst Jones has insisted that Matlock disliked many of Johnny Rotten’s controversial lyrics, Matlock has said that he had no issue with them.</p><p>Matlock left the band in late February 1977, with contemporary reports (given to news outlets by manager Malcolm McLaren) stating that he was ‘thrown out’ because he “liked the Beatles”. The claim was fictional. Another claim, made at the time by Jones, that he thought it bizarre that Matlock was “always washing his feet”, has also been misquoted and misinterpreted as the cause of Matlock’s firing from the group.</p><p align=justify>His family was residing in Paddington, West London when he was born.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glen Matlock</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Matlock</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bassist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Glen Matlock ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
