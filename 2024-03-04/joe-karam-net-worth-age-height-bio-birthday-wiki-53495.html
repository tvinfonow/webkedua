According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Joe Karam</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Joseph Francis “Joe” Karam (born 21 November 1951), also known by the nickname of “Clock”, is a New Zealand former representative rugby footballer who played for the All Blacks. After retiring from rugby, he became a businessman. However, he is most notable for waging a successful 15-year campaign to have David Bain’s convictions for murder overturned, and a subsequent campaign seeking compensation for him.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rugby Union Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Karam is known for his many years of unqualified support for David Bain, who was convicted in 1995 of murdering all five members of his family. Karam’s research and sustained pressure on the justice system culminated in an appeal to the Privy Council in Britain in May 2007, at which Bain’s conviction was overturned. The Privy Council found there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice, quashed his convictions and ordered a retrial. After his convictions were quashed, Karam allowed Bain to stay at his house in the Waikato on bail prior to the retrial two years later. Bain stayed for about three months before moving to Auckland. The new trial was held in 2009 and Bain was found not guilty on all five charges.</p><p>Without Karam’s support, it is unlikely there would ever have been a retrial. His interest in the case began in 1996, when he read a newspaper article about “an old music teacher and a bunch of young, long-haired university students” trying to raise money for Bain’s appeal by selling jam. He went and gave them money. He began to study the evidence presented at the original trial and began to feel something was wrong with the case. He went to visit Bain in prison in Christchurch and subsequently visited him over 200 times. According to media commentator Paul Holmes, Karam was appalled at the way the family, the Police and the Fire Service arranged to burn the Bain house down.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Joe Karam height</b> <strong>1.73&nbsp;m</strong> Jonas <strong>weight</strong> <strong>82 kg (12 st 13 lb)</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1.73&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>82 kg (12 st 13 lb)</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Karam switched codes in 1975, signing a three-year deal with the Glenora Bears in the Auckland Rugby League competition $20,000 a year. Karam was horrified that players on the UK tour of 1971 got a pound a day as their living allowance while rugby officials “were flying around the world drinking champagne like it was going out of fashion”. For players of “modest employment” slogging it out on the field for their country it meant that “their wife and children were starving back home”.</p><p align=justify>Karam believes the fact that it took 13 years to get Bain’s conviction overturned shows how flawed the New Zealand justice system is. In 2007 he said he planned to set up an organisation similar to the Innocence Project in the US, where those with skills and resources offer their help pro bono, like a support club for single crusaders such as himself, Keith Hunter and Mike Kalaugher (the Scott Watson campaigners).</p><h2>Who is Joe Karam Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Joe Karam</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

The first was “David and Goliath: the Bain family murders” published in 1997. Karam made accusations against two police officers in David and Goliath as a result of which he was sued for defamation. (He won that case as well.) The book created a media furore. Karam appeared regularly on the Holmes TV show and ‘did a thousand other media interviews’. The second book, “Bain and Beyond” was published in 2000 and the third, “Innocent!: seven critical flaws in the conviction of David Bain” came out in 2001. The fourth book “Trial By Ambush: The Prosecutions Of David Bain” was released in 2012. In this book, Karam accuses Robin Bain of the murders of his wife and three of their children before shooting himself.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Jonas Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rugby Union Player</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in New Zealand</strong>. Joe Karam celebrates birthday on November 21 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Karam acknowledges that fighting the case has taken its toll on him over the years. Interviewed in the New Zealand Herald in 2007 under the headline Joe Karam: Freedom Fighter, he said, “For many years, the mainstream media, judiciary, and politicians just thought of me as a raving redneck who’d lost the plot.” He stopped socialising with rich-list friends because people would inevitably “buttonhole him about the case” and he felt compelled to put them straight – “destroying the dinner party” in the process. He said that “every morning for two years, he would wake up, sink to the edge of the bed and cry”. When asked what motivated him to keep going, he said it was because of his “innate hatred of unfairness and urge to help those less fortunate”.</p>You may read full biography about Joe Karam from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfn7ymecqaqZqlXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=/2024-03-04/john-miller-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-53473.html>&#171;&nbsp;John Miller Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a>
