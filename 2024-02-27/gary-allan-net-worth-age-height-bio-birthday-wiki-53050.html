Country musician known for his gold-certified debut album Used Heart for Sale, which includes the song “Her Man.”&nbsp;The singer has had seven of his songs achieve the top 10, including “Nothing on but The Radio” and “Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain).”</p><p>His smash hit “Her Man,” previously recorded by&nbsp;His hit “Her Man,” previously recorded by <a href=#>Waylon Jennings</a>, was on the top twenties chart.&nbsp;and His hit “Her Man,” previously recorded by <a href=#>Waylon Jennings</a>, was on the top twenties chart., was a top 20th century hit. chart.</p><p>Allan was introduced to songwriter/producer Byron Hill on August 28, 1993, by a mutual friend and talent-scout Jim Seal, at a bar called the Lion D’or in Downey, California, where Allan was already regularly performing. Seal and Hill had asked Allan if they could showcase an unsigned act that they were developing there. Hill had arranged to bring the head of A&R from a major label to the show to see this other act perform. Allan kindly let them use his stage for the event, giving the new act the opening performance slot that night. Hill promised Gary that they would make sure the A&R person remained there to see his portion of the show. Everyone was knocked out with Allan’s performance, and very impressed with his voice. From that point on, Byron Hill began sending Gary songs. Without any serious funding at the time, Hill arranged for Allan to go into Seal’s small studio in California to try his vocals on some of existing demo tracks that Byron had sent to Gary from Nashville, Tennessee. Meanwhile, Hill became head of A&R at BNA Entertainment on October 29 of that same year and immediately wanted to sign Allan to BNA, but the then current roster conditions and other circumstances related to the planned restructuring of RCA/BNA Nashville stood in the way.</p><p>The meeting was to arrange two showcases in Los Angeles, California, to put Allan on stage at two of the radio station’s regular nights at a local club. Byron arranged for staffers at the Nashville office of Decca Records to attend the first showcase held on November 1, 1995. Decca immediately wanted to sign Allan, and knowing that Byron was lining up other labels to see Gary, Decca asked them to cancel the second showcase. A rep from RCA was already booked to see the second showcase the following week, but the “bird-in-hand” deal offer was too tempting for both Byron and Gary, so they committed to the Decca offer. Decca staffer Mark Wright and Byron Hill co-produced Gary’s first three albums for Decca beginning sessions on March 11, 1996 for Used Heart for Sale, then It Would Be You, both of which yielded top five singles, and later Smoke Rings in the Dark (which also included Tony Brown as a co-producer). It was during the recording of the first album that they recorded “It Must Have Been Ol’ Santa Claus”, as an added track to be packaged on various MCA/Decca Christmas compilations. Then Byron and Gary got a personal call from Harry Connick, Jr., the writer of the song, thanking them for the recording, during which he added a few of his New Orleans Jazz style “very cool man!” compliments. The Christmas recording has been since released on at least four compilations. The merger of Polygram, Decca, and MCA Records marked the closing of Decca and Gary was moved to MCA Records.</p><p align=justify>He got married Tracy Taylor in 1987, later he modelled Danette Day, in the year 1998, and later Angela Herzberg on June 5 in 2001.&nbsp;His third marriage ended in divorce after Angela tragically ended her own life in 2004.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gary Allan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gary</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Allan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>La Mirada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Angela Herzberg , Danette Day Herzberg</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dallas Herzberg, Maggie Herzberg, Tanna Herzberg</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Gary Allan ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The album was named “Best of the Month” by Stereo Review. It advanced to the Top 20 of the charts. Its first single, “Her Man” (previously recorded by Waylon Jennings) gave Allan his first Top 10 country hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Other tracks from this album, however, proved less successful.</p><h2>Gary Allan Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Gary Allan is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.

Signed to Decca Records in 1996, Allan made his country music debut with the release of his single “Her Man”, the lead-off to his gold-certified debut album Used Heart for Sale, which was released in 1996 on Decca. His second album, It Would Be You, followed in 1998. Allan’s third album, Smoke Rings in the Dark, was his first one for MCA Nashville (to which he has been signed ever since) and his first platinum album. His next albums, Alright Guy (2001) and See If I Care (2003), both were also certified platinum while Tough All Over (2005) and Greatest Hits (2007) and Living Hard (2007) were all certified gold. His next two albums Get Off on the Pain (2010) and Set You Free (2013) both reached the Top 10 on the U.S. Billboard Top Country Albums charts, at numbers 2 and 1 respectively.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Allan’s second studio album, It Would Be You, was released in 1998. Although he has been writing songs since his teen years, the singer has not really hesitated to bump his work from his albums in favor of those written by other songwriters that he respects. For this album, Allan replaced one of his songs with “No Judgement Day”, written by Allen Shamblin. Even though that song was a hidden acoustic track, radio stations started giving it some heavy airplay. “No Judgement Today” tells the story of a restaurant owner from a small town in Texas, where ex co-workers killed him in search of money, for drugs and alcohol. The album’s title track became Allan’s second hit to reach the Top 10 on the U.S. country charts, remaining there after 21 weeks of radio play, “way beyond the tenure of most disposable radio hits.” In early-1999, Decca Records folded, and when Allan moved to the parent label, MCA Nashville, the It Would Be You album was left in limbo.</p><p>In 1987, Gary married his first wife, Tracy Taylor. They have since divorced. He married model Danette Day on November 28, 1998, in South Carolina and they divorced in June 1999. His third wife, Angela (whom he wed on June 5, 2001), died by suicide on October 25, 2004.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Gary Allan height</b> <strong>5 ft 11 in</strong> Gary <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 11 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the meantime, Allan took a job selling cars. He left a demo tape in the glove box of a truck purchased by a wealthy couple. When the couple discovered that he was the singer, they wrote him a check for $12,000. This independent funding allowed Allan to go to Nashville to record some of the songs that were on that early demo tape with Byron Hill as producer. On September 11, 1995, they worked at Javelina Studios for a couple of days on the four songs that Hill immediately showed to labels. Allan’s recordings brought serious responses from several labels including Mercury, RCA, and Decca. A meeting was then held at a Nashville hotel among Hill, Allan, and friend of Allan’s, who was a program director for a radio station in California.</p><p align=justify>The singer’s fourth studio album Alright Guy was released in 2001. It contained the singles “The One,” “Man of Me,” and “Man to Man,” the latter of which became his first number one hit on the U.S. Billboard country charts.
