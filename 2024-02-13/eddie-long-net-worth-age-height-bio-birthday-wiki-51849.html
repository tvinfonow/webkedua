Long’s sermons, writings and teachings emphasize a “chain of command” between certain superiors and subordinates characterized by “respect, submission and obedience”. Long saw the first link in the chain as being a man choosing to be respectful, submissive and obedient to God. A woman chooses to be respectful, submissive and obedient to her father or husband. To live otherwise is to be outside of the divinely established order, and will result in the loss of spiritual and natural benefits. Long was considered a preacher of the prosperity gospel who taught that his followers would be blessed with material wealth.</p><h2>Eddie Long Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Eddie Long is one of the <strong>richest Religious Leader</strong> from United States.
