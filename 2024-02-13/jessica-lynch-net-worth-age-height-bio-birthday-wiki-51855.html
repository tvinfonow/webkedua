U.S. Army soldier who became a POW during the Iraq War and was rescued by the U.S. Special Operations Forces in 2003.</p><p>She and <a href=#>Don Rickles</a> both served in the armed forces.</p><p>Jessica Dawn Lynch (born April 26, 1983) is a former United States Army soldier who served in the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. and allied forces. On March 23, 2003, Private First Class Lynch was serving as a unit supply specialist with the 507th Maintenance Company when her convoy was ambushed by Iraqi forces during the Battle of Nasiriyah. Lynch was seriously injured. Her subsequent recovery by U.S. Special Operations Forces on April 1, 2003 received considerable media coverage; it was the first successful rescue of an American prisoner of war since World War II and the first ever of a woman. Initial official reports on Lynch’s capture and rescue in Iraq were incorrect. On April 24, 2007, she testified in front of Congress that she had never fired her weapon (her M16 rifle having jammed), and that she had been knocked unconscious when her vehicle crashed. Lynch has been outspoken in her criticism of the original stories reported regarding her combat experience. When asked about her heroine status, she stated “That wasn’t me. I’m not about to take credit for something I didn’t do … I’m just a survivor.”</p><p>Lynch was born in Palestine, West Virginia, the second child and first daughter to Deidre Lynch and Gregory Lynch, Sr. Her family could not afford to send her to college; her older brother had to drop out due to financial reasons. Searching for a way to pay for the children’s educations, the Lynch family met with an army recruiter in the summer of 2000 when Lynch was seventeen and still attending high school. “He did not lie to the kids,” her mother said, “he said there was always the possibility of war in the future.” “But at that time it was before September 11, and there was no terrorism,” Lynch recalls, “so we were like, ‘that would never happen to me.'” On September 19, 2001, Lynch entered basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. She later completed Advanced Individual Training for her Military Occupational Specialty as a unit supply specialist (MOS 92Y) in the Quartermaster Corps at Fort Lee, Virginia.</p><p align=justify>Her parents were Deidre and Gregory Lynch.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jessica Lynch</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jessica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lynch</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>War Hero</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Palestine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>West Virginia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gregory Lynch, Deidre Lynch</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gregory Lynch Jr., Brandi Lynch</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dakota Ann</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jessica Lynch ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

All three were ambushed in the same attack during the Iraq War on March 23, 2003, with Piestewa being killed and Lynch and Johnson being injured and taken prisoner. Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, received far more media coverage than Johnson (a black woman and a single mother) and Piestewa (a Hopi from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave more attention to the woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.</p><p align=justify>In the initial press briefing on April 2, 2003, the Pentagon released a five-minute video of the rescue and claimed that Lynch had stab and bullet wounds, and that she had been slapped while on her hospital bed and interrogated.</p><h2>Who is Jessica Lynch Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jessica Lynch</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
