No other cars were involved. Police found four syringes with an injectable form of cocaine in them and a small plastic bag with cocaine residue on it. The next day police conducted a search of her hotel room, where they discovered more cocaine and drug paraphernalia. In November 2001, through a plea bargain, Bleeth pleaded guilty to possessing less than 25&nbsp;grams of cocaine and to driving while impaired. She was sentenced in January 2002 to two years of probation and 100 hours of community service. Bleeth’s lawyer, Jerry Sabbota, stated after sentencing that the actress was satisfied with the plea bargain, noting that her record will be cleared of any felonies after she fulfills the terms of her probation. “When all is said and done she’ll have a traffic ticket on her record. She wasn’t treated any better than anyone else, and she wasn’t treated any worse,” Sabbota said. Her attorney stated that Bleeth was receiving therapy from the founder of the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic that she had previously attended in 2000. Bleeth completely fulfilled the terms of her probation as of January 2004, and her record was cleared as determined by the plea bargain.

Bleeth wrote that her cocaine habit was so severe that she collapsed at a photo shoot for Glamour, and she went without sleep for five days at a time. She wrote that “consciously trying to stay off drugs is now part of my life and always will be.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Yasmine Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular TV Actress</strong>.
