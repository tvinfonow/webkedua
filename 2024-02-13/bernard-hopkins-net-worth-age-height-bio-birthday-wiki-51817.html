Hopkins turned to crime early in his life. By the age of thirteen he was mugging people and had been stabbed three times. At seventeen, Hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in Graterford Prison for nine felonies. While in prison he witnessed the murder of another inmate in an argument over a pack of cigarettes, but also discovered his passion for boxing. After serving almost five years, Hopkins was released from prison in 1988. He then decided to use boxing as an escape from his previous life, and converted to Islam. While Hopkins was leaving the prison for the final time, the warden told him he’d “see [Hopkins] again when you wind up back in here”, to which Hopkins replied “I ain’t ever coming back here.” Later, Hopkins attributed his personal discipline to his experiences and time spent in Graterford Prison.</p><h2>Bernard Hopkins Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Bernard Hopkins is one of the <strong>richest Boxer</strong> from United States.

Hopkins said to HBO in the post fight interview, “He shoved me out of the ring. My ankle got twist when I fell out of the ring. I couldn’t stand on my feet. If I wouldn’t have been pushed out of the ring, I believe he was starting to fade… I can’t believe they gave him a TKO. They can call it a no contest but not a loss.
