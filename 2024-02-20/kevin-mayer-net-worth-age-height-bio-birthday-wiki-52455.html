Mayer was born on 10 February 1992 in Argenteuil, a commune in the northwest suburbs of Paris, to André and Carole Mayer. His paternal family and German surname have their origin in the northeastern region of Lorraine, where his father grew up; some of his relatives still live in the Moselle department next to the border with Germany. He has three brothers: Thibault, Thomas and Sébastien; the family was raised in La Roche-de-Glun, a small town by the Rhône river in the southeast of the country (Drôme department), where his parents still live.</p><p>Mayer started practicing athletics at the sports association EA Tain-Tournon close to his hometown; after the club’s merger with two other Drôme-based athletics associations in 2013, Mayer continued representing it through the new institution, EA Rhône Vercors 26-07. He trains at the CREPS Montpellier, a training center for high-performance athletes, since 2008; ever since moving to Montpellier, he has been coached by Bertrand Valcin. He studied for a fr:Diplôme universitaire de technologie en mesures physiques (a technological degree in physical measurements, including metrology and instrumentation) at the University of Montpellier-Sète.</p><p>On 12 August 2015, Mayer announced his withdrawal from the 2015 World Championships because of a hamstring injury sustained in the end of July 2015.</p><p>At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Mayer earned a silver medal with a new personal best of 8834 points, finishing behind only two-time gold medallist Ashton Eaton, who was the world record holder at the time. Highlights of his campaign include equalling or improving personal outdoor bests in four events (100 m, shot put, 400 m, pole vault) and performing seasonal bests in three others (long jump, high jump, 1500 m); he was also the best decathlete in two disciplines (the shot put, with 15.76 m and 836 points; and the pole vault, with 5.40 m and 1035 points, sharing first place with Thomas van der Plaetsen) and lead the standings at the end of the first day of the competition (i.e. after 5 out of 10 events). Furthermore, this performance ranks as the sixth-best personal best score in the men’s decathlon, and showed a marked improvement in form for Mayer, bettering his former personal best of 8521 points (set during the aforementioned silver medal run at the 2014 European Athletics Championships) by 313 points and the French national record by 260 points.</p><p align=justify>He competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics, finishing 15th.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin Mayer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kévin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kévin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Athletics Competitor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1992</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Argenteuil</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Argenteuil</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>France</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kevin Mayer ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
