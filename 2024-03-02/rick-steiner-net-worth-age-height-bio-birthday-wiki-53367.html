His most prominent accomplishments are his WCW stint, where he won seven Tag Team World Championships.</p><p>He shared the WCW Tag Team World Championships win with his brother&nbsp;He won seven of his eight WCW Tag Team World Championships with his brother, <a href=#>Scott Steiner</a>..</p><p>Steiner was an amateur wrestling standout at the University of Michigan, where he placed second at the Big Ten Championships in 1983 for the Wolverines, became an NCAA qualifier, and established the fastest pin record in the school’s history at 15 seconds. At the 1983 NCAA tournament, Steiner wrestled against Tab Thacker of North Carolina State; Thacker went on to fame as a Hollywood actor. After earning his bachelor’s degree in education, he was introduced to professional wrestling by George “The Animal” Steele and entered the business immediately out of college. He initially wrestled under the name Rob Rechsteiner before he took on the simpler ring name Rick Steiner. He spent time in the American Wrestling Association, Montreal promotion International Wrestling, and the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). While in the UWF he formed a tag team with Sting, winning the UWF World Tag Team Championship in 1987. Also in 1987 he wrestled for New Japan Pro Wrestling. The UWF was bought out by Jim Crockett Jr. in 1988, acquiring much of its roster (including Steiner), for his National Wrestling Alliance territory, Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP).</p><p>Steiner was a charter member of the faction known as The Varsity Club along with Mike Rotunda and their manager Kevin Sullivan, with the long-term angle being that Rotunda was favored by Sullivan and both of them looked at Steiner as their dull-witted underling. It also started a slow fan favorite turn for Steiner, as he began breaking rules less often and was portrayed as a dim but good-hearted guy who was a villain by association only. Steiner and Rotunda were given a spot at the second ever Clash of the Champions, which took place in Miami on June 8, 1988. The duo faced Jimmy Garvin and Ronnie Garvin in a losing effort. Eventually, this would lead to a breakup and Steiner subsequently became a fan favorite before winning the Television Championship from Rotunda at Starrcade.</p><p align=justify>During his career, he married Jamye Steiner and had three children with her.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rick Steiner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steiner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bay City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Janece Rechsteiner, LeeRoy Rechsteiner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Scott Steiner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jayme McKenzie</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bronson Rechsteiner, Maveric Rechsteiner, Hudson Rechsteiner</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rick Steiner ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
