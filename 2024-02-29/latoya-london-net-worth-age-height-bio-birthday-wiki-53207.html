Simon Cowell, who previously endorsed her as the best singer in the competition, suggested that his only complaint with London was that after ten weeks he still did not know anything at all about her. Cowell also suggested that contestant Jasmine Trias would almost certainly be voted off the next day. However, on May 12, London became the ninth of the 12 finalists to be eliminated, finishing in fourth place, with Barrino also landing in the bottom two. London’s farewell song was “Don’t Rain on My Parade.”</p><p>London was central to one of the first controversies of the show. On April 21, 2004, the night after the final seven contestants performed Barry Manilow songs, London, Jennifer Hudson, and eventual winner Fantasia Barrino ended up in the bottom three with the least viewer votes. Together, these three had been dubbed “The Three Divas” for their critically acclaimed performances. London had the highest vote totals out of the three, and Hudson was ultimately eliminated. Because all three of the singers were African American and the frontrunners of the competition, music icon Elton John deemed the voting as “racist,” igniting a flurry of news and speculation over the validity of the voting system. John complained at a promotional news conference that, “The three people I was really impressed with, and they just happened to be black, young female singers, and they all seem to be landing in the bottom three.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>LaToya London height</b> Not available right now.
