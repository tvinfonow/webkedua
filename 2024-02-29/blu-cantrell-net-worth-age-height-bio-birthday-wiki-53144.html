In 1999, she became member of the girl band 8th Avenue, a protegé of singer Teddy Riley. While the band recorded several songs and appeared on Blackstreet’s 1999 album Finally, their material was left unused after Riley left Blackstreet to reform his previous group Guy and Blackstreet were subsequently dropped by Interscope Records, also leading to 8th Avenue’s disbandment. Soon after, Cantrell was introduced by both a dancer friend and R&B singer Usher to Red Zone Entertainment head, music producer Tricky Stewart. Stewart originally wanted her to become a member of his girl group 321, but soon offered Cantrell to work with her as a solo artist following a fruitful recording session. Cantrell subsequently moved in with Stewart and his girlfriend in their Atlanta house, and was promptly placed with Arista Records head Antonio “L.A.” Reid who offered the singer a contract with the company after hearing one song she wrote and sang in front of him and his staff. After a bidding war with several different labels, Reid’s bid was the highest, prompting Cantrell to sign with them.</p><p>After her signing with Arista, Cantrell went straight into recording sessions with Dallas Austin and Stewart as well as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. In July 2001, her debut album, So Blu, was released. The record earned generally favorable reviews from critics and became a commercial success, particularly in North America, where it peaked at number eight on the US Billboard 200. It was eventually certified gold by both the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Music Canada. The album’s lead single “Hit ‘Em Up Style (Oops!)” became a top ten hit in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Netherlands and peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100.
