When he became old enough to drive he borrowed a friend’s MKIII Supra and drift it around a cone course he set up in a parking lot.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Chris Forsberg</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He attended his first drag racing event at the age of ten.</p><p align=justify>Popular across social media he has attracted more than 470,000 followers to Instagram.</p><p align=justify>Forsberg was set to debut his twin-turbocharged VQ-powered car at round 1 in Long Beach, California, where the car passed tech inspection, but an engine failure before practice and qualifying made him call a last-minute decision to run his old V8-powered 370Z, which he used for the first 3 rounds of the season, recording two Top-8 finishes and a Top-16 finish. Forsberg then debuted his VQ-powered 370Z at round 4 in New Jersey, but struggled to find grip on his new platform which only allowed him to earn three consecutive Top-32 finishes. Forsberg then ended his bad luck curse with second place at the penultimate round in Texas, and a Top-16 finish at the final round at Irwindale, California. His struggles and inconsistency with the new car only allowed him to finish a frustrating 12th in the final overall standings.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Race Car Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2016, despite not winning an event, Forsberg was crowned Formula Drift champion once again piloting his V8-powered Nissan 370Z. His consistency (two third-place finishes and four second-place finishes, all consecutively) allowed him to take the championship lead after round 6 in Seattle, which he continued to defend until the final round in Irwindale. He also won the Formula Drift World Championship after participating in a Formula Drift World Championship round in Okayama, Japan, which made him eligible to score World Championship points.</p><p>For the 2018 Formula Drift season, Forsberg continued to team up with Ryan Tuerck, but switched to Nexen Tires after Hankook Tire announced their withdrawal from the sport. Forsberg now operates and manages his own team which proved successful after winning Round Two of the 2018 season in Orlando.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Chris Forsberg height</b> Not available right now.
