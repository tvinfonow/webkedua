I project onto canvas, trace the masses with a blue pencil, paint the details freehand with a sable brush, and the larger areas two to four times (for opacity) with Japanese or decorator’s brushes. I often change figures to get it right. I paint incessantly at home—paintings take up to three months.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Paul Harvey height</b> Not available right now.

Harvey made works featuring famous double acts to emphasise the sales message of “The Original Double”, a reference to the twin-size packets of papers made by Job. Harvey’s enthusiasm for the project came about because “Mucha is one of his heroes”, said Mark Ross, the director of Glorious Creative agency managing the campaign. The work created some controversy: Gilbert and George gave their endorsement to the images, but The Mighty Boosh and The White Stripes were not pleased to be featured. Famous Doubles, a show of the original paintings used for the posters, was promoted at the Wanted Gallery in Notting Hill by Fraser Kee Scott, director of the A Gallery.</p><h2>Who is Paul Harvey Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Paul Harvey</strong> married to <strong>Lynne Cooper Harvey (m. 1940–2008)</strong>.
