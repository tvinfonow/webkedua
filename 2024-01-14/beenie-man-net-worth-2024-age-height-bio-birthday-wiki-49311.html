He found his artistic home at the Shocking Vibes studio where he continued to record singles with only moderate success in the early 1990s. His career gained momentum after a performance at the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1992, and a rivalry with Bounty Killer began the following year after Beenie Man was accused of stealing Bounty Killer’s style and catch phrases. The rivalry was captured on the 1994 album Guns Out, with the two artists settling the feud with a soundclash. Beenie Man had his first number one single in Jamaica in 1993 with “Matie” (Produced by Ephraim Barrett, Donovan and Dave Mills on the Shelly Power Records label) and he won the DJ of the Year Award the same year, the first of eight consecutive awards.</p><p align=justify>He has a brother, Kirk.&nbsp;He was married Michelle Downer from 2006 to 2012; they had an infant son named Marco.&nbsp;Additionally, he has daughters who are from various relationships.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Beenie Man</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Beenie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Man</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kingston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kingston Parish</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michelle Downer</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Desha Davis, Crystal Davis, Marco Dean</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Beenie Man ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal Maestro, produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid to late 1990s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of “Dancehall King”, a title only bestowed previously on Yellowman in the early 1980s. Beenie Man’s first real break into the United States came in 1997. He heard an instrumental rhythm by an unknown producer named Jeremy Harding, and demanded to add his voice to the rhythm. So this was the birth of his first international hit; he recorded “Who Am I” and the single quickly went Gold. It opened the doors for the world to see a new reggae star in the pages of Newsweek and other major media outlets. The same year, Beenie Man topped the Jamaican singles chart with seven different singles.</p><h2>Beenie Man Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Beenie Man is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from Jamaica.

I was baptised an Ethiopian Orthodox and at the age of 10 I became a Judah Coptic.” In 1994, he was signed by Island Records and released the critically acclaimed album Blessed, which established his reputation internationally. In 1995 he toured the UK and joined up again with Barrington Levy to record an updated jungle version of Levy’s “Under Mi Sensi”.</p><p align=justify>In 2002, he had a sizeable hit with a duet with Janet Jackson called “Feel It Boy”, but his biggest break in America came in early 2004 with the release of a remix of “Dude”, featuring guest vocals by fellow Jamaican Ms. Thing as well as rhymes by Shawnna.
