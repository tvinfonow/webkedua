Who is Mike McKenzie dating now & how much money does Mike McKenzie have?</p><h2>Mike McKenzie Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Mike McKenzie</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Ice Hockey Player</strong> who was born on <strong>April 29, 1986</strong> in Whitby, Whitby, <strong>Canada</strong>. The Rangers had a very successful season in 2015-16, as the club earned a 44-17-7 record, accumulating 95 points and a fourth place finish in the Western Conference. Kitchener made the second round of the playoffs, however, they were swept by the London Knights in four games. Following the season, Mike Van Ryn stepped down as head coach of the team, and was replaced by Jay McKee. McKenzie remained an assistant coach on the coaching staff.</p><p>In 2008-09, during his junior season with the Saints, McKenzie saw his offensive production increase to new heights, as he scored 16 goals and 34 points in 38 games to lead the club in scoring. For the second consecutive season, McKenzie was named to the ECAC All-Academic Team.</p><p>Prior to the 2019=20 season, McKenzie acquired goaltender Jacob Ingham from the Mississauga Steelheads to solidify the position. Also, due to the uncertainty of overage forward Joseph Garreffa returning to Kitchener for the season, McKenzie acquired overage forward Liam Hawel from the Guelph Storm, as the Rangers boasted three of the top overage players in the league, with Greg Meireles and Jonathan Yantsis as the other overage players on the club. The Rangers eventually traded Garreffa to the Ottawa 67’s for draft picks. Kitchener drafted import defenseman and Arizona Coyotes prospect Axel Bergkvist at the 2019 CHL Import Draft to help out the blue line. The club got off to a slow start, posting a 7-10-2-2 record and sitting in last place through their first 21 games. On November 25, 2019, McKenzie relieved head coach Jay McKee of his duties and named himself as the interim head coach. In his first game as head coach of the Rangers on November 28, Kitchener defeated the Erie Otters 5-4 in a shootout, as McKenzie earned his first career OHL victory. Under McKenzie, Kitchener had a very impressive 33-6-3-0 record, as the team climbed from last place in the Midwest Division to finish the season with a 40-16-5-2 record, earning 87 points, and second place in the division. Due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in North America, the post-season was cancelled.</p><p>On August 3, 2010, McKenzie signed a one-year contract with the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League. The Checkers were the top affiliate of the Carolina Hurricanes, as McKenzie had an amateur tryout with their previous AHL affiliate, the Albany River Rats in the 2009-10 season.</p><p align=justify>In his sophomore season with the club during the 2007-08 season, McKenzie skated in 34 games, scoring seven goals and 20 points for the rebuilding Saints. McKenzie was named to the ECAC All-Academic Team during this season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike McKenzie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ice Hockey Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1986</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Whitby</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Whitby</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bob McKenzie</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rachel McKenzie</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike McKenzie ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
