Following Parramatta’s close victory against Brisbane in July 2007, Hayne was accused of diving to impede Brisbane’s momentum after a heavy hit from Sam Thaiday. Then Brisbane coach Wayne Bennett said “You talk about ethics in our sport. You talk about not laying on the ground” and then claimed Hayne should be cited for “bringing the game into disrepute.” Hayne denied that he dived to deliberately impede Brisbane’s momentum and claimed that he was genuinely hurt after the collision with Thaiday. He was never found guilty of any wrongdoing by the NRL Judiciary. In the 2007 Grand Final qualifier, Hayne was again accused of diving when he stayed down and received a penalty for a high shot. Players also accused Hayne of winking after the incident, Clint Newton saying “To lay down like he did and then get up and wink, I don’t think that’s in the spirit of the game. Straight after he got up, he winked at Dallas Johnson – facing us.” Hayne denied the accusations, saying, “I don’t engage in that shit, I just score tries and make people happy”.</p><p>Hayne is a Christian.
