Despite receiving a lukewarm response at the box office, the film and Sinha gathered praise, with Sinha’s portrayal of Pakhi, a Bengali girl who is dying of tuberculosis, receiving universal acclaim from critics. Sarita Tanwar notes that “the star of the film is undoubtedly Sonakshi Sinha [who gives] a mature and refined performance. She lives the character body and soul.” Raja Sen agrees, saying that “Sonakshi Sinha plays Pakhi beautifully, creating a character who is immaculately wide-eyed and possesses casual, yet unmistakable, grace. It is a performance that starts off dreamily soft and turns harder, and she does well-etched dialogue justice like few actresses can. There’s a discernible vulnerability to Pakhi throughout the film, and Sinha brings out this fragility perfectly without ever overplaying it.”</p><p>In 2014, after providing her voice for the voice of Jewel in the Hindi-dubbed Rio 2, Sinha was seen in A.R. Murugadoss’s action thriller Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty, a remake of the director’s Tamil film Thuppakki. Starring opposite Akshay Kumar, Sinha appeared as a boxer. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and emerged as a box office hit. Jyoti Sharma Bawa said of Sinha’s portrayal: “Sonakshi has nothing to do much in the film and overacts in places. For an actor who has already proved her mettle in the acting department, this definitely is a downer.” Sinha appeared in a music video with Yo Yo Honey Singh titled Superstar. In July, Sinha jointly bought a team in the World Kabaddi League. Her second release of 2014 was Prabhu Deva’s Action Jackson, with Ajay Devgn and Yami Gautam.

Despite this, critic Rajeev Masand criticized her ornamental role and wrote that Sinha “seems to exist in this film only to have her midriff repeatedly pinched by Akshay Kumar.” Her next film, Shirish Kunder’s Joker, also opposite Akshay Kumar, proved to be a commercial disaster at the box office and received overwhelmingly negative reviews.</p><p align=justify>In 2015, she appeared in Boney Kapoor’s remake of Okkadu, titled Tevar, opposite Arjun Kapoor. In his review, Rajeev Masand wrote: “Sonakshi Sinha, playing another simpering damsel in another South remake, once again has nothing to do. She appears content showing up for a few dance numbers, and waiting around for a man to save her.” Tevar underperformed at the box office and was one of the biggest flops of the year.</p><h2>Who is Sonakshi Sinha Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Sonakshi Sinha</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
