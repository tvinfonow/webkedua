Through 1979, White was the Cowboys’ punter and the backup to the team’s star quarterback Roger Staubach. After Staubach’s retirement following the end of that season, White became the Cowboys’ starting quarterback. Until 1984, White continued to serve as the team’s punter; he punted for the last time in his career once in 1985.</p><h2>Danny White Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Danny White is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Danny White</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was a student at Arizona State University as a baseball player, but the head football head coach&nbsp;He originally attended Arizona State University as a baseball player, but head football coach <a href=#>Frank Kush</a> made it a provision of his scholarship that he punt for the football team as well.&nbsp;made it a condition of his scholarship that he throw on behalf of the team, too.</p><p align=justify>In his initial seasons with the Cowboys He was not just the team’s quarterback but among the NFL’s top punters.</p><p align=justify>White’s father, Wilford White (no relation to college football legend and U.S. Supreme Court justice Byron White, who also was nicknamed “Whizzer” and played American football), was the first Arizona State University All-American football player and still ranks second in school history with 1502 rushing yards in a season, he also played halfback for the Chicago Bears from 1951–52.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>White led the Cowboys to three consecutive NFC Championship Games (1980–1982), but was criticized after the Cowboys lost each of the three games despite having been favored in all of them. White also received criticism for publicly siding with the owners during the 1982 NFL Players Strike. Fans and teammates alike began to show support for White to be replaced as the Cowboys quarterback by Gary Hogeboom, who was coming off an impressive performance in the 1982 NFC Championship Game (which they lost to the archrival Washington Redskins) after White was knocked out of the game with a concussion. Even White’s statistically career-best 1983 season failed to silence the critics, after ending it with consecutive blowout losses to the Redskins (at home) and the 49ers after a 12–2 start. To add insult to injury, the Cowboys lost the NFC Wildcard Playoff game to the Los Angeles Rams. That apparently was enough for White to lose his starting job to Hogeboom at the start of the 1984 season. Under Hogeboom, the Cowboys looked impressive with a 4–1 start, but then a loss to division rival St. Louis and ineffective plays by Hogeboom convinced coach Tom Landry to reinstate White as his starter. The Cowboys finished 9–7, but missed the playoffs in 1984 for the first time in a decade; but with White as quarterback, the Cowboys made it back in 1985 with a 10–6 record. However, they lost again to the Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs.</p><p>In a memorable 1980 playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons, White led the Cowboys to a come-from-behind 30–27 victory. He also played in one of the Cowboys’ most painful playoff losses against the San Francisco 49ers in the 1981 NFC Championship Game, famous for the Joe Montana-to-Dwight Clark game-winning play, which would simply come to be known as “The Catch”. He received Pro Bowl and second team All-Pro honors in 1982.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Danny White height</b> Not available right now.

During these two years, he passed for 2,635 yards and 21 touchdowns in 30 games, and also led the league in punting his last year.</p><p align=justify>In 1986, the Cowboys started 6–2, had the #1 offense in the NFL, were tied for the lead in the NFC Eastern Division and White was also the number one rated passer in the NFC at that point in the season. During an away game against Bill Parcells’s New York Giants, however, a blind-side sack by Giants linebacker Carl Banks broke White’s throwing wrist and tore ligaments, knocking him out of the game and ending his season. Dallas lost the game, 17–14, and without White the team faded badly, finishing the year 7–9 and the Cowboys first losing season since 1965.</p><h2>Who is Danny White Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Danny White</strong> married to <strong>JoLynn White </strong>.
