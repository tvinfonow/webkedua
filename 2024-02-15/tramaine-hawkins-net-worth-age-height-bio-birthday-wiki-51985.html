Who is Tramaine Hawkins dating now & how much money does Tramaine Hawkins have?</p><h2>Tramaine Hawkins Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Tramaine Hawkins</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>October 11, 1951</strong> in San Francisco, <strong>United States</strong>. Tramaine Aunzola Richardson , (nee’ Davis) known professionally as Tramaine Hawkins (born October 11, 1951), is an American award–winning Gospel singer whose career spans over five decades. Since beginning her career in 1966, Hawkins has won two Grammy Awards, two Doves, and 19 Stellar Awards.</p><p>At the age of 17, Hawkins sang on the Edwin Hawkins Singers Choir’s single “Oh Happy Day”. With her distinctive soprano and extensive vocal range, she became better known as a featured soloist with late husband Walter Hawkins’ Love Center Choir as well as the Hawkins Family. Hawkins scored several hits as a solo artist in the 1980s while signed to Light Records, and released now-classic albums, such as her 1979 self-titled debut, Tramaine, and its 1983 follow-up Determined. Songs such as “Changed,” “Goin Up Yonder”, “He’s That Kind Of Friend”, Jesus Christ Is The Way” and “Highway” quickly became staples and fan favorites.</p><p>However, Hawkins was somewhat ostracized by her core gospel music audience, who were soured by her music’s lyrically neutral content and the heavy mainstream attention it received. Though “Fall Down” became one of the earliest gospel songs to crossover to mainstream charts, traditional fans balked. Nonetheless, Freedom followed in 1987, producing “The Rock” and its title track as singles. The latter was co-written and produced by The Jacksons. Nearly 15 years later, “Fall Down” received a resurgence of popularity as gospel singer Kelli Williams recorded a remake of the hit as “Fall Down 2000”, produced by avant garde gospel artist Tonéx. Though the song had not been widely acknowledged in the gospel music community, the more than eight-minute extended dance mix was finally included on Hawkins’s 2001 collection All My Best To You, Vol. 2. In the new millennium, Hawkins resurfaced on GospoCentric Records with a powerful release, Still Tramaine. This album included traditional gospel songs along with a duet with ex-husband, the late Walter Hawkins, on “It’s Your Power”. Also included on Still Tramaine was a track titled “Over There”, an uptempo track reminiscent of “Fall Down”.</p><p>Following harsh criticism and backlash from the success of her A&M recordings, Hawkins signed with Sparrow and delivered 1988’s The Joy That Floods My Soul, including the opener “All Things Are Possible.” The stellar set quickly re-endeared Hawkins to her core audience. Between album releases, Hawkins made a cameo on MC Hammer’s 1990 pop-gospel hit “Do Not Pass Me By”. She was also honored with a request to sing at the funeral of Sammy Davis, Jr. when the beloved entertainment legend died in May 1990. She was also a guest lead vocalist on Santana’s June 1990 album “Spirits Dancing in the Flesh”.</p><p align=justify>While married to Walter Hawkins from 1971 until 1994 (23 years), the couple had two children, a son, Walter “Jamie” Hawkins and a daughter, Trystan Hawkins, with four granddaughters and three grandsons. Hawkins now refers to herself as “Lady Tramaine”. She lives outside of Sacramento, California, with her husband Tommie Richardson Jr. She has one stepson, Demar(Chelesta), and two step-grandsons.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tramaine Hawkins</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tramaine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tramaine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Francisco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lois Davis, Ronald Davis.</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tommy Richardson</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Walter Hawkins Jr, Trystan Hawkins</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tramaine Hawkins ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

New music would not surface until Hawkins’ 2000 cameo appearance on gospel trio Trin-i-tee 5:7’s recorded cover of her signature tune “Highway”. Following this foreshadowing, Hawkins delivered the tour-de-force studio recording Still Tramaine in 2001 after signing a new contract with GospoCentric Records. The album would also give a nod to her former career as a dance-floor darling featuring Basement Boys club remixes of the single “By His Strength”.</p><h2>Tramaine Hawkins Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tramaine Hawkins is one of the <strong>richest Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Tramaine Hawkins</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>While still in high school, Hawkins and her friends, Mary McCreary, Elva Mouton, and Vet Stone, had a gospel group called the Heavenly Tones that performed at various venues around the Oakland and San Francisco areas. In 1966 the group recorded the album I Love the Lord for the Gospel label, part of Savoy Records, and a 45 for the Music City label called He’s Alright. When Stone’s older brother Sylvester, better known as Sly Stone, formed Sly & the Family Stone with their brother Freddie and friends Larry Graham, Cynthia Robinson, Jerry Martini, and Greg Errico, the Heavenly Tones were recruited directly out of high school to become Little Sister, Sly & the Family Stone’s background vocalists for their recording. Hawkins left the group to focus solely on recording and singing gospel music.</p><p align=justify>Hawkins was briefly a member of the 1970s R&B/soul vocal group Honey Cone. The group recorded the R&B hit “Want Ads” which made its way back into the gospel genre by being sampled on Mary Mary’s 2005 hit “Heaven”. Hawkins also briefly sang with Andrae Crouch and The Disciples, singing lead on their 1970 release “Christian People.” Hawkins is both famous and infamous for her mainstream success as a gospel artist. In the mid-1980s, she signed with A&M Records and released a pair of dance-oriented contemporary gospel albums. Her 1985 A&M debut The Search Is Over yielded dance chart singles such as “Child of the King,” “In the Morning Time,” and the monster club hit “Fall Down (Spirit of Love)”. The latter topped the Billboard Dance Charts to A&M’s delight.</p><p align=justify>Hawkins won her first Grammy Award in 1981 for her participation performance on “The Lord’s Prayer”, along with her then-husband Walter Hawkins.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Hawkins again paid final tribute to an African-American legend when she was requested in 2005 to sing at the funeral service of civil rights activist Rosa Parks.

The grandiose recording with its sweeping arrangements and show-stopping medleys of fan favorites would become a benchmark in Hawkins’ career. The set eventually vindicated Hawkins in total by winning a much-coveted Grammy Award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album in 1991.
