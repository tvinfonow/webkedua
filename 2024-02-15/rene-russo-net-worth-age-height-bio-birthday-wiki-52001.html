With Crosby’s encouragement, Russo applied to, and was signed by, Ford Modeling Agency. She became one of the top models of the 1970s and early 1980s, appearing on magazine covers for Vogue, Mademoiselle, and Cosmopolitan, as well as advertisements for perfume and cosmetics. Vogue in a 2016 article, wrote: “In the ’70s, Russo stood for a sexiness that was both accessible and aspirational: She could vamp it up with the best of them, posing for Francesco Scavullo in decadent furs, or swathed in Versace for Richard Avedon, but Russo wasn’t your average pinup. The poise she brought to her images made her the first choice for editorial shoots that demanded models with tenacity, whether she was bound for the boardroom in a power suit or posing on a beach with Tony Spinelli”.</p><p>Russo was born in Burbank, California, the daughter of Shirley (née Balocca), a factory worker and barmaid, and Nino Russo, a sculptor and car mechanic who left the family when Russo was two. Her father was of Italian descent, while her mother had Italian, German, and English ancestry. Russo grew up with her mother and her sister, Toni (who was married to lyricist Bernie Taupin between 1979 and 1991), and attended Burroughs High School, where her classmates included director Ron Howard. She was plagued with scoliosis and had to wear a full-torso brace. Her tall height also earned her the nickname “Jolly Green Giant” from her classmates. In a 2019 interview with Financial Times, she indeed described herself as a “geek”, and admitted that the bullying she endured during high school made her drop out in the tenth grade. Growing up, Russo did not have any “ambitions”, remarking that she “was too busy just trying to survive, along with my sister and my mom —money was tight, my mom worked two jobs”. She began taking a variety of part-time jobs to help her family, including working in an eyeglass factory and as a movie theater cashier. She eventually got scouted for modelling and went to New York City, which she described as a “scary place compared to where I grew up”.</p><p align=justify>In 1992, she married&nbsp;Dan Gilroy&nbsp;and Rose was born in August 1993.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rene Russo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rene</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Russo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Burbank</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Nino Russo (A Sculptor And Car Mechanic Who Left The Family When Rene Was Two.)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Shirley (née Balocca) (A Factory Worker And Barmaid.)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Anthony John Russo, David Russo, January Debra Russo, Toni Russo, Jim Russo</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dan Gilroy (m. 1992)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rose Gilroy</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rene Russo ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
