Muriel Elizabeth Bowser, /’baUz@r/; born August 2, 1972, is an American politician. She has been the mayor of the District of Columbia from 2015.&nbsp;She is a member of the Democratic Party and previously represented Ward 4 on the Council of the District of Columbia between 2007 and 2015.&nbsp;Bowser was elected to Advisory Neighborhood Commission in 2004. She succeeded Adrian Fenty who had been elected Mayor.&nbsp;In 2008 and 2012, she was reelected and ran for mayor in 2014.&nbsp;In the Democratic primary, she defeated Vincent C. Gray, the incumbent Mayor. She won the general election with 54.53% of votes against three Independent candidates and two minor parties.&nbsp;Bowser was reelected in 2018 with 76.4%.&nbsp;After Sharon Pratt Kelly and Bowser, she is the second woman to hold the office of mayor. She also became the first woman elected mayor of the District of Columbia.&nbsp;A Washington Post poll found that the majority of D.C. residents support her running for a third term in 2022.</p><p>Bowser declared her reelection bid for the Council in 2008.&nbsp;Baruti Akil Jahi (former president of Shepherd Park Citizens Association), Malik Mendenhall Johnson (then serving as Advisory Neighborhood Commission of 4B04), and Paul E. Montague (previously Advisory Neighborhood Commissar of 4B07, before being recalled in 2004, were all candidates against Bowser).&nbsp;Bowser was attacked by Jahi and Mendenhall Johnson, who claimed she was a passive supporter of Mayor Fenty and was not concerned about her constituents’ needs.</p><p>Bowser ran for reelection in 2012. Bowser said she would not turn down donations from corporations. Candidate Max Skolnik criticized Bowser for receiving campaign contributions from developers, corporate bundlers, and lobbyists, saying that Bowser would favor the interests of these corporate donors. Bowser said she was not in favor of banning corporations from making political donations altogether, saying that doing so would make it more difficult to track where campaign donations come from. She also said that corporations are banned from donating to federal elections, but that corporations still find ways to give to campaigns.</p><p>On March 23, 2013, Bowser announced that she would run for Mayor of the District of Columbia in the 2014 election. Her campaign’s chair was former council member William Lightfoot.</p><p align=justify>Adrian Fenty was a member of the Council of the District of Columbia and represented Ward 4. He ran for Mayor of the District.&nbsp;Bowser was his campaign manager for Ward 4.&nbsp;In 2006, Fenty was elected mayor. A special election was held to fill the vacant council seat.&nbsp;Bowser was among others who announced their candidacy.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Muriel Bowser</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Muriel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bowser</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington, D.C.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Muriel Elizabeth Bowser</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Joan Bowser, Joe Bowser</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Muriel Bowser ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The following year, the number of traffic fatalities increased from 26 to 28 and the number of crash injuries increased from 12,122 to 12,430. Pedestrian fatalities within the total dropped from 15 to 9, during a period when pedestrian deaths nationally had jumped upward by 11 percent. In 2017, traffic fatalities continued to rise.

Soon thereafter Bowser was confronted by a throng of about 100 protesters who were angry that she had not responded more forcefully—as had mayors of some other sanctuary cities—in denouncing Trump’s policies and in defending immigrants. In January 2017, following Trump’s inauguration and the issuance of a Presidential Executive Order threatening to withhold Federal funding from sanctuary cities, Bowser affirmed that the District would maintain its status as such.</p><p align=justify>Upon taking office in 2015, Bowser set a goal to halve the number of HIV/AIDS cases in the District by 2020.

During the winter of 2015, the District saw an increase of more than 250 percent over any previous year, in homeless families housed in shelters and overflow motel rooms, although part of the increase was due to the administration’s decision to move families into motel rooms before freezing temperatures would require it do so under the law. In February 2016, Bowser unveiled a plan to provide housing for homeless families following the closure of District of Columbia General Hospital. Without any community consultation or input, Bowser announced the location of one shelter in each of the District’s eight wards and refused to say how the sites were selected. In March 2016, it was revealed that many of the sites selected were connected to Bowser’s contributors. Under Bowser’s plan, the monthly cost per unit was $4,500 on average each year for at least the next 20 years. Frustrated by the D.C. Council’s efforts to devise its own plan, Bowser lashed out with expletives at Chairman Phil Mendelson.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Muriel Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Politician</strong>.
