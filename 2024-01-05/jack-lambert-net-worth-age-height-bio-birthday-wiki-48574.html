Former NFL linebacker who was a 9-time Pro Bowl selection during his 11 seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was a member of four Super Bowl Championship teams.</p><p><a href=#>Terry Bradshaw</a> was the MVP during 2 of his 4 Super Bowl victories with the Steelers.</p><p>Lambert was selected by the Steelers in the second round of the 1974 NFL Draft, though many pro football coaches and scouts thought he was too small to play linebacker in the NFL. (Lambert played quarterback at Crestwood HS before switching to defensive end at Kent State.) While most of his pro career he was reported to be 6’4″ and 220 pounds in the program, he measured 6’3½” and 204 pounds as a rookie.</p><p>In 1976, Lambert assumed the role as leader of the Steelers after star defensive tackle “Mean Joe” Greene missed several games due to a chronic back injury. After quarterback Terry Bradshaw, receiver Lynn Swann and several other starters went down with injuries, the Steelers struggled to a 1–4 record. At a “players only” meeting, Lambert made it clear that “the only way we are going to the playoffs to defend our title is to win them all from here out.” In a remarkable nine-game span, the Steelers defense allowed only two touchdowns and a total of 28 points, including five shutouts. The Steelers won all of these games and finished at 10–4. The defense gave up only a record low 138 points for the entire season. Eight of the eleven defensive starters on the Steelers made the Pro Bowl that year. Jack Lambert was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1976.</p><p align=justify>He married Lisa Harbison and had four children with her.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jack Lambert</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jack</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lambert</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mantua</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lisa Lambert</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ty Lambert, Elizabeth Lambert, Lauren Lambert</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jack Lambert ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
