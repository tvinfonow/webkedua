Bembenek was the eldest of three daughters born to Joseph and Virginia Bembenek in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the 15th of August 1958.&nbsp;Joseph Bembenek had previously worked for the Milwaukee Police Department but quit following the corruption he claimed to have witnessed in the police department.&nbsp;Later, he worked as carpenter.</p><p>After graduation, Bembenek was employed in retail, and also had an unintentional stint as model.&nbsp;The year 1978 was the first time she was featured with the title “Miss March” in a calendar published from The Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company.</p><p>While training at the Milwaukee Police Academy, Bembenek met and became close with another female trainee, Judy Zess. At a rock concert in May 1980, Zess was arrested for smoking marijuana. Bembenek’s subsequent dismissal from the police department on August 25 stemmed from her involvement in filing a false report on Zess’ arrest. After being fired, Bembenek discovered photos of Milwaukee police officers dancing nude and semi-nude at a party sponsored by a local bar in Milwaukee’s Riverwest district. She had also witnessed the wide-spread use of marijuana, cocaine and other drugs by several members of local law enforcement. Bembenek came across evidence that the metro-area drug kingpin at the time, the notorious Ron Peters, was supplying the drugs for recreational use to the police and to members of the Milwaukee Brewers major league baseball club, including Paul Molitor, the inside distributor for Peters with the Brewers. Molitor in a subsequent plea deal was forced to leave Milwaukee and join the Toronto Blue Jays. The Milwaukee district attorney mandated that Molitor remain absolutely drug free for any subsequent visits to Milwaukee, such as for baseball games. Peters was busted and jailed after long surveillance by the FBI, who staked out his lower flat along N. Sherman Blvd. by occupying the upper flat, having been granted permission by the two nurses who lived there at the time but worked on the south side at St. Luke’s Hospital. The news media were called by the FBI to stage their reporters and cameras when the bust occurred, including vivid video in the darkness lit up by television lights as a tow truck hauled Peters’ Porsche away to impound.</p><p>In March 1980, Bembenek began training at the Milwaukee Police Academy. While still a trainee, an anonymous tipster reported that Bembenek was seen smoking marijuana at a party. Bembenek denied the charge which was investigated but never substantiated. Bembenek later said she believed the accusation was made by the wife of a Milwaukee police officer who confronted her at a party about her clothing and accused Bembenek of leading her husband on. Bembenek graduated from the Academy in the summer of 1980 and was assigned to the South Side Second District of Milwaukee. In her autobiography Woman on the Run, Bembenek claimed that the Milwaukee Police Department was then composed of “brutal, lazy, apathetic and corrupt” police officers. She further claimed that female and minority officers were routinely subjected to harassment and abuse during training. Bembenek stated that when females and minorities trainees became members of the police force, they were often severely punished or fired for minor infractions during their probationary period while white male officers went unpunished for more serious offenses.</p><p align=justify>Bembenek was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended St. Augustine Elementary School as well as St. Mary’s Academy in Milwaukee.&nbsp;She then moved onto Bay View High School where she graduated in the year 1976.&nbsp;Following graduation, she attended Bryant & Stratton College, where she graduated with an associate’s degree in fashion management.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Laurie Bembenek</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Laurie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bembenek</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Autobiographer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Milwaukee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wisconsin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Marty Carson , Elfred O.

Fred Schultz initially stated he was on duty investigating a burglary with his partner, Michael Durfee, at the time of the murder, but years later he admitted they were actually drinking at a local bar. When ballistics testing allegedly revealed it was his off-duty revolver that had been the murder weapon, suspicion shifted to Laurie Bembenek, as she had been alone in the apartment she shared with Schultz and had access to both the gun and a key to Christine’s house that Fred Schultz had secretly copied from his oldest son’s house key. Bembenek was arrested for Christine Schultz’s murder on June 24, 1981.</p><p align=justify>On June 28, 1983, Bembenek filed for divorce from Fred Schultz. In an interview she gave to The Milwaukee Sentinel, Bembenek said that Schultz had written her a letter informing her that he was living with a 19-year-old woman in Florida and had decided to end their marriage. Their divorce was granted on June 19, 1984. While Schultz had initially stood by Bembenek and believed she was innocent, he later changed his mind and publicly stated that he believed she was “Guilty as sin.” Bembenek also came to believe that Fred Schultz was guilty of hiring someone to murder Christine and allowed her to take the fall. The real murderer was Freddy Horenberger. He, along with an accomplice, had been questioned nearby days before the murder by a Milwaukee County Sheriffs Department deputy. Bembenek contended that the attorney whom Schultz had hired to represent her had a conflict of interest and had purposely failed to inform the jury that there was evidence that Schultz was connected to the murder.</p><h2>Who is Laurie Bembenek Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Laurie Bembenek</strong> married to <strong>Marty Carson , Elfred O.

Dr. Elaine Samuels, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, had originally concluded that hairs recovered from the body were consistent with that of the victim; after Dr. Samuels had come to that conclusion, the hair evidence was examined by Diane Hanson, a hair analyst from a crime lab in Madison, Wisconsin. Hanson stated that two of the hairs were consistent with samples taken from Laurie Bembenek’s hairbrush. Dr. Samuels refuted that claim, stating in a 1983 letter, quoted in the Toronto Star in 1991, that “I recovered no blonde or red hairs of any length or texture … [A]ll of the hairs I recovered from the body were brown and were grossly identical to the hair of the victim … [I] do not like to suggest that evidence was altered in any way, but I can find no logical explanation for what amounted to the appearance of blonde hair in an envelope that contained no such hair at the time it was sealed by me.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Laurie Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Autobiographer</strong>.
