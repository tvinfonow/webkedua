According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Reese Witherspoon</b>'s net worth <strong>$200 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was selected to become a fashion model for a florist television advertisement at age seven.</p><p align=justify>She voiced the lead character Susan Murphy, aka Ginormica, in the 2009 animated feature Monsters vs. Aliens.</p><p align=justify>In addition, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for “collaborative video of the year” from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon has expressed her passion for the film: “I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems.” She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: “I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn’t really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn’t try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman.” After the success of Walk the Line, Witherspoon starred in the fantasy Penelope, as Annie, the best friend of Penelope (Christina Ricci), a girl who has a curse in her family. The film was produced by her company Type A Films, and filming began in March 2006.
