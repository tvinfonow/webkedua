When she was seven, a bone was growing through her spinal cord, a condition that required surgery. She had a 50/50 chance of coming out of it paralyzed. Andrews discovered her passion for singing in the fourth grade. Andrews planned on dancing in her school’s talent show, but her sister convinced her to sing Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You” instead. At 11, she put her first band together. Meanwhile, after someone sent a song of her singing to producer Byron Gallimore, Andrews signed with DreamWorks Records Nashville and soon began working on her first album. Prior to its release, she began opening for Faith Hill on her Fall 1998 tour, as well as for Tim McGraw (also produced by Gallimore) for his New Year’s Eve concert.</p><p>At the age of 15, Andrews released her debut album, Heart Shaped World. Gallimore, who was sensitive to her age, let her record 50 songs before settling on the 12 that appear on the album. Serving as its debut single was “I Will Be There for You”, which Andrews had recorded in November 1998 for the Nashville soundtrack to the DreamWorks Animation film The Prince of Egypt. The song reached No.&nbsp;28 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts in 1999. In March of that year, she also performed the song on an episode of the soap opera Another World; One month later, she made her debut on the Grand Ole Opry. Also in 2000, she toured with Trisha Yearwood. Heart Shaped World also produced two more Top 40 country singles in “You Go First (Do You Wanna Kiss)” and “Unbreakable Heart”, although the fourth single (“I Do Now”) failed to reach Top 40. The album itself peaked at No.&nbsp;24 on the Top Country Albums charts. Andrews was also featured on the premiere episode of On the Verge, a television series on CMT which followed the careers of up-and-coming country artists. On May 3, 2000, Andrews was invited to sing “Unbreakable Heart” at the 2000 Academy of Country Music awards, where she won the award for Top New Female Vocalist.</p><p align=justify>She was married to fellow country star Marcel.&nbsp;She has a younger sister named Kellie.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jessica Andrews</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jessica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrews</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wynne</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Arkansas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jesse Andrews, Vicki Andrews</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Marcel</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jessica Andrews ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In a 2001 interview, Andrews explained that she recorded the song (which was written by Brett James and Troy Verges) because she felt that its lyrics were especially fitting to her own life: “Everything is so true in that song, except that my grandmother’s name is not Rosemary. It’s about believing in yourself and being supported by those around you. No matter how many mistakes you make, your friends and family will be there for you.” Also included on the album was Andrews’ first songwriting credit in the track “Good Friend to Me”, which she co-wrote with Annie Roboff and Bekka Bramlett.</p><h2>Jessica Andrews Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jessica Andrews is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.
