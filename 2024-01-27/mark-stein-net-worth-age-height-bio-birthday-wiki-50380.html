Stein also played in the 1994 FA Cup Final and, in total, he scored 25 goals in 63 games for the West London club, but by the 1996–97 season had lost his place in the first team due to the arrival of new strikers Mark Hughes, Gianluca Vialli and Gianfranco Zola.

He finally left Chelsea in the summer of 1998 when he signed for AFC Bournemouth after a loan spell.</p><h2>Mark Stein Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mark Stein is one of the <strong>richest Soccer Player</strong> from United States.

Mark cited his father’s work as a South African anti-apartheid activist as inspiration for this; “My Dad was a political activist who fought against racism in South Africa all his life.

He signed for Oxford United in September 1989 after failing out of favour at Loftus Road. After two seasons with Oxford Stein found himself out of the side and playing in the reserves. He joined Stoke City on loan in September 1991 and played five matches without scoring. But he impressed manager Lou Macari with his contribution so much that he persuaded the board to pay £100,000 for his services. It proved to be a sound piece of business as Stein went on a fine run, scoring 22 goals in 1991–92 helping Stoke reach the play-offs where they lost to Stockport County although they did beat County in the 1992 Football League Trophy Final with Stein scoring the game’s only goal. Stoke fans named Stein “The Golden One” and he went on to top-score in 1992–93 as Stoke won the Second Division title, Stein scoring 33 goals in 57 matches. In 1993–94 Stein hit the headlines after scoring twice past Manchester United in the League Cup. After Macari moved to Celtic Stein also left the Victoria Ground moving to Premier League Chelsea for a fee of £1.5 million.</p><h2>Who is Mark Stein Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mark Stein</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
