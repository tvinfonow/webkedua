A second location opened in Windsor in 1999, a third in Petaluma in 2000 or 2001 (since closed), and a fourth in Roseville in late 2008. Subsequently, they developed Tex Wasabi’s (barbecue and sushi) in 2003 in Santa Rosa, adding a second location in Sacramento’s Arden-Arcade area in 2007 (which was rebranded as Johnny Garlic’s, and then subsequently closed). An additional Johnny Garlic’s was opened in Dublin, California, in 2011. His first New York City restaurant, Guy’s American Kitchen and Bar, opened in 2012 to brutal New York Times coverage by Pete Wells that Larry Olmsted of Forbes called “the most scathing review in the history of the New York Times”, and “likely the most widely read restaurant review ever.” Fieri, for his part, accused Wells, the nation’s highest profile reviewer, of using Fieri’s fame as a platform for advancing his own prestige. Despite appearing on Restaurant Business’s list of the top 100 independent restaurants as ranked by sales for four years in a row, the restaurant announced plans to close at the end of 2017. In 2011, Fieri partnered with Carnival Cruise lines to create Guy’s Burger Joint to sell Fieri’s burgers fleet-wide. As of October 2017, there were 19 restaurants on Carnival’s cruise ships, including some serving beer-and-BBQ, Guy’s Pig & Anchor Smokehouse Brewhouse.</p><p>After winning the second season of The Next Food Network Star on April 23, 2006, Fieri was awarded a six-episode commitment for his own cooking show on Food Network.

On his return to the United States, he worked at the restaurant at the Red Lion Inn in Eureka, California, until he went to Las Vegas for college. Fieri attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Hotel Management in 1990.

The New York Times called the series “not a cooking show as much as a carefully engineered reality show”. Ultimate Recipe Showdown, co-hosted with Marc Summers, debuted on February 17, 2008, and aired for three seasons. On September 14, 2008, Guy Off the Hook debuted on Food Network. This special studio audience show aired through the end of 2008, but the extra cost of staging an audience show did not result in a ratings bump and the concept was discontinued. For Thanksgiving 2008, Fieri hosted a one-hour special titled Guy’s Family Feast. He used the “Guy Off the Hook” set for the special, which was broadcast live, on November 28, 2008. Fieri appeared on other Food Network programs such as Dinner: Impossible in 2007 and 2009, Paula’s Party, Ace of Cakes, and The Best Thing I Ever Ate.</p><h2>Who is Guy Fieri Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Guy Fieri</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
