He was cast as Simon Doyle in the 1978 film adaptation of Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile at the age of 25. He became a friend of co-star Bette Davis, reflecting, “There was a feeling of being in awe of these people but I had a certain amount of pioneer courage, so I didn’t let it get to me. But there were days when I thought, ‘I’m about to do a scene with this cinema legend, am I up to it?’ But people were very gracious. I was never the whipping boy because I was less experienced.” The role boosted MacCorkindale public profile and he considered it to be his career break. He won the London Evening Standard Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer for this part. MacCorkindale went on to star as sailor and spy Arthur Davies in The Riddle of the Sands (1979), the film adaptation of the celebrated Erskine Childers’ novel.</p><h2>Simon MacCorkindale Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Simon MacCorkindale is one of the <strong>richest Tv Actor</strong> from United States.

He had previously starred in an episode of Kneale’s series Beasts and enjoyed appearing in the role of Kapp, finding it a change from the typecast romantic roles that he had become accustomed to playing, while noting that it was “challenging” conveying the character’s strong Jewish faith. Kneale later expressed disappointment with MacCorkindale’s performance, commenting, “We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that”.</p><p>MacCorkindale produced, directed and wrote a number of film, television and theatre productions throughout his career.

His first professional stage performance was in a 1973 run of A Bequest to the Nation at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. He made his West End theatre debut in a production of Pygmalion in 1974, appearing alongside Alec McCowen and Diana Rigg in the role of “Sarcastic Bystander”. In 1973, the series Hawkeye, The Pathfinder had given MacCorkindale his first TV credit. He went on to appear in a number of other TV series, including Within These Walls, Sutherland’s Law, I, Claudius (as Lucius Caesar) and Jesus of Nazareth.</p><p align=justify>Following the success of Death on the Nile, MacCorkindale moved to the United States in 1980. Although warned that it would limit his chance of finding work, MacCorkindale refused to adopt an American accent when auditioning, believing that his British diction would help fill a “niche”. However, for two years he failed at the audition stage for all major parts on account of his nationality. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) told MacCorkindale that he was not an “eight o’clock actor”, which he took to mean that “at that time of night they didn’t want viewers watching someone who sounded intellectual or who had an accent that was alien to their ears and, therefore, hard work when it came to listening.” During this time he appeared in single-episode roles in series such as Dynasty, Fantasy Island, Hart to Hart, Matt Houston and The Dukes of Hazzard, as well as playing David Clement, an aristocrat, in the mini-series Manions of America.</p><h2>Who is Simon MacCorkindale Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Simon MacCorkindale</strong> married to <strong>Susan George , Fiona Fullerton </strong>.

The role impressed MacCorkindale, who considered Chase to be a “very cerebral individual”. He also “found himself in the first wave of British stars to make it big in America,” along with Joan Collins in Dynasty, which led to a further influx of British actors finding work in the United States. Filming on Manimal would often run for as long as 14 to 16 hours per day, and MacCorkindale would sometimes be required to work at weekends to be made up with the prosthetics necessary for Manimal’ s transformation sequences. The low ratings that resulted in the cancellation of Manimal after one season and eight episodes was in part due to NBC broadcasting the series at the same time as Dallas on CBS, Manimal losing out to the more popular “soap”. Budget cuts also contributed to the series’ cancellation as it was the network’s most expensive series. Manimal has since acquired a global cult following.</p><h3>What cancer did Simon MacCorkindale have?</h3><p>The actor revealed last year he was diagnosed with <b>bowel cancer</b> in 2006, but was told it was terminal after it spread to his lungs a year later.
