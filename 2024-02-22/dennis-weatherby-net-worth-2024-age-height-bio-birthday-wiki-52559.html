There he served as a role model and advisor for black and other young minority men and women and also chaired external programs such as an undergraduate science symposium for showcasing students’ research from six area colleges and universities. An MEP (Minority Engineering Program) report stated that minority first-year freshman pre-engineering students involved in the program in 1998–99 had a mean grad-point average over their first three academic quarters of 2.70. Nearly 79 percent of the participants had GPAs equal to or better than the 2.20 required to begin taking engineering courses. By comparison, white first year freshman pre-engineering students had a mean GPA after three quarters of 2.56 and just below 70 percent had the required 2.20 GPA. Weatherby left Auburn to become an associate dean of the graduate school at the University of Notre Dame in 2004.

Before his invention, pigments were used in such solutions that often stained dishes and dishwasher interiors. With fellow inventor Brian J. Roselle, he received U.S. patent No. 4,714,562, issued on December 22, 1987, for his breakthrough “Automatic dishwasher detergent composition.” The solution serves as the basic formula behind all of today’s “lemon-scented” cleaning products containing bleach.</p><h2>Who is Dennis Weatherby Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Dennis Weatherby</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
