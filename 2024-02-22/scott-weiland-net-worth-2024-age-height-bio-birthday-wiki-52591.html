Frontman of the 90s grunge group”the Stone Temple Pilots, the group that released smash singles such as “Creep,” “Interstate Love Song,” and “Vaseline.”</p><p>He said&nbsp;He claimed that <a href=#>Jim Morrison</a> inspired his style of singing.&nbsp;inspired his style of singing.</p><p>In 1986, Weiland met bassist Robert DeLeo at a Black Flag concert in Long Beach, California. The two of them were discussing their love interests, when they realized one of them was the same girl they were both dating. They developed a bond over the incident, and ended up moving into her vacated apartment. Weiland’s childhood friends Corey Hicock and David Allin rounded out the group, both of whom would soon be replaced by Eric Kretz and DeLeo’s brother Dean. They took the name Stone Temple Pilots because of their fondness for the initials “STP.” In one of the band’s first opening performances as Mighty Joe Young, they opened for Electric Love Hogs, whose guitarist Dave Kushner would one day co-found Weiland’s later band Velvet Revolver. In 1992, they released their first album, Core, spawning four hits (“Sex Type Thing,” “Wicked Garden,” “Creep,” and “Plush.”)</p><p>Weiland’s vocal and musical style proved to be versatile, evolving constantly throughout his career. At the peak of Stone Temple Pilots’ success in the early to mid-1990s, Weiland displayed a deep, baritone vocal style that was initially closely compared to that of Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder. However, as STP continued to branch out throughout its career, so did Weiland’s vocal style. The band’s third album, Tiny Music… Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop, had Weiland singing in a much higher, raspier tone to complement the band’s more 60’s rock-influenced sound on that album. Later albums showcased Weiland’s influences ranging from bossa nova on Shangri-La Dee Da to blues rock and classic rock on the band’s 2010 self-titled album.</p><p align=justify>The couple was Janina Castenada between 1994 and 2000.
