Bulger began to summon drug dealers from in and around Boston to his headquarters. Flanked by Kevin Weeks and Flemmi, he would inform each dealer that he had been offered a substantial sum to assassinate them. He would then demand a large cash payment not to do so.</p><p>On the night of May 11, 1982, Bulger was told the whereabouts of a former associate turned federal informant, Edward Brian Halloran, known on the streets as “Balloonhead”. After arriving at the scene, Weeks staked out Anthony’s Pier 4 Restaurant, where Halloran and construction worker Michael Donahue were dining together. As Donahue and Halloran drove out of the parking lot Weeks signaled Bulger by stating, “The balloon is in the air”, over a hand held radio. Bulger drove up with a masked man armed with a silenced Mac 10; Bulger himself carried a .30 caliber carbine. Bulger and the other shooter opened fire and sprayed Halloran and Donahue’s car with bullets. Donahue was shot in the head and killed instantly. Halloran lived long enough to identify his attacker as James “Gentleman Jim” Mulvey, a Winter Hill associate, who was later tried and acquitted. Mulvey remained the prime suspect, even though he had relocated to the Pacific Northwest after an apparent falling out with Bulger after he discovered Bulger was also an FBI informant, until 1999, when Weeks agreed to cooperate with investigators.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kevin Weeks height</b> Not available right now.
