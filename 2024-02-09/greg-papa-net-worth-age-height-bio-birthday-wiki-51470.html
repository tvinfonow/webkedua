The Raiders hired Papa for the 1997 season, replacing Joel Meyers, who had himself replaced King. His work was very much in the tradition of his predecessor, Bill King. Like King, his touchdown calls were punctuated by “TOUCHDOWN, RRRRAID-ERS!!!” Papa’s best calls arguably were: Tyrone Wheatley’s 26-yard run in the Raiders 1999 finale against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium (“Wheatley won’t go down!!!”) along with describing the events during the Tuck Rule game, when the Raiders seemingly had won a 2001 playoff game during a snow storm at New England after forcing a late fumble, only to see referee Walt Coleman reverse the call after consulting instant replay. The Patriots went on to win the historic, controversial contest in overtime.</p><p>Beginning with the 2019 season, Papa took over as the radio voice of the 49ers, handling the play-by-play duties for the team on KNBR 680 with analyst Tim Ryan.
