Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Santorum was mired in controversy and spent much of his time on the campaign defending his past statements and positions. He faced criticism from Casey and others for several statements in his book, It Takes a Family, including his denunciation of 1960s “radical feminism”, which he said had made it “socially affirming to work outside the home” at the expense of child care. In the book, Santorum also compared pro-choice Americans to “German Nazis.” John Brabender, an adviser to Santorum’s Senate and presidential races, reflected back on the book’s controversies and said Santorum was warned that sections could bring political damage, and Santorum was not willing to change much of it simply to gain moderate supporters. In addition, a past article Santorum wrote to The Catholic Online resurfaced in 2005, in which he linked liberalism and moral relativism in American society, particularly within seminaries, to the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal. He wrote, “it is no surprise that Boston, a seat of academic, political and cultural liberalism in America, lies at the center of the storm.” His remarks were heavily criticized, especially in Massachusetts, and he was asked for an explanation. Santorum did not retract his statement and defended his premise that it was “no surprise that the center of the Catholic Church abuse took place in very liberal, or perhaps the nation’s most liberal area, Boston.” Casey also raised the question of Santorum’s association with the K Street Project.</p><h2>Rick Santorum Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Rick Santorum is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United States.

In October 2006 he gave a “Gathering Storm” speech, invoking British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s description of Europe prior to World War II. As evidence that Islamists were waging a more than 300-year-old crusade against the Western world, Santorum pointed to September 11, 1683, the date of the Battle of Vienna. Casey responded, “No one believes terrorists are going to be more likely to attack us because I defeat Rick Santorum.” Noting that he had been “even more hawkish” during this time period than President Bush, Santorum later said, “Maybe that wasn’t the smartest political strategy, spending the last few months running purely on national security”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Santorum has said he does not believe a “right to privacy” is part of the Constitution. He has criticized the Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which held that the Constitution guaranteed that right and overturned a law prohibiting the sale of contraceptives to married couples. Santorum has asserted that the right to privacy set forth in Griswold was a “jurisprudential novelty [that] quickly become a constitutional wrecking ball” and eventually led the Court to recognize a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade (1973). In critiquing Griswold, Santorum emphasized that he did not support laws banning contraceptives. Santorum has, however, described contraception as “a license to do things in [the] sexual realm that [are] counter to how things are supposed to be.”</p><p>Santorum first became actively involved in politics in the 1970s through volunteering for Senator John Heinz, a Republican from Pennsylvania.
