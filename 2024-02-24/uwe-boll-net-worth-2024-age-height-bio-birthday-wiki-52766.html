German director of video game adaptations including House of the Dead, Bloodrayne, and Postal.</p><p>He was still able to attract A-list talent like <a href=#>Ben Kingsley</a> in spite of winning Razzie Awards and receiving incredibly negative responses to his films.</p><p>Boll was born in Wermelskirchen. He studied at the University of Cologne and in 1994 published a dissertation (“Hochschulschrift”) at the University of Siegen.</p><p>Electronic Gaming Monthly’s November 2006 edition’s “The Rest of the Crap” section, written by critic Seanbaby, described Seanbaby’s own involvement. Boll was going to appear on G4’s Attack of the Show! to promote this fight by sparring with one of the hosts. Seanbaby stated that, “Again, he’s a matchmaking genius, because everyone on TV is three feet tall. If you were watching Attack of the Show during the time I cohosted, you might have noticed that I could have leaned over and eaten host Kevin Pereira.” A producer of the show then asked if Seanbaby would come and spar in the host’s place for the event. Seanbaby said that he trains in muay thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, stating that “boxing is to fighting what Hungry Hungry Hippos is to fighting”, but that he was eager to fight Boll nonetheless. When Uwe heard of this, he wanted to know Seanbaby’s age, height, weight and fighting experience since he “learned he wasn’t fighting a midget.” Seanbaby stated he sent said information to Boll, after which Boll chose not to appear on the program. Boll similarly declined to fight Canadian comedian Ron Sparks.</p><p align=justify>He married and had a child with a Canadian woman.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Uwe Boll</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Uwe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boll</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Director</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wermelskirchen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Germany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Natalia Tudge</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Walter Boll</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Uwe Boll ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In June 2006, his production company issued a press release stating that Boll would challenge his five harshest critics each to a 10-round boxing match. Invitations were also open to film directors Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary. To qualify, critics had to have written two extremely negative reviews of Boll, in print or on the Web. In 2005, footage from the fights were to be included on the DVD of his upcoming film Postal. On June 20, 2006, Rich “Lowtax” Kyanka stated on Something Awful that he had been invited by Boll to be the first contestant, after Kyanka reviewed Alone in the Dark. The online gambling site GoldenPalace.com decided to sponsor this event, dubbing it “Raging Boll” (a play on the 1980 Martin Scorsese film Raging Bull). A lot was drawn up in late August 2006, featuring Kyanka, Rue Morgue magazine writer Chris Alexander, webmaster of Cinecutre Carlos Palencia Jimenez-Arguello, Ain’t it Cool News writer Jeff Sneider, and Chance Minter, amateur boxer and website critic. Boll fought and won against all five participants. The first match took place on September 5, 2006, in Estepona, Spain, against Carlos Palencia. The others battled on September 23, 2006, at the Plaza of Nations in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p><p align=justify>In April 2008, The Guardian ran an article claiming Boll had promised to retire if an online petition at PetitionOnline.com asking him to do so received 1,000,000 signatures.
