However, some teams lost interest when Hamels broke his left humerus during his sophomore year. Nonetheless, Hamels was drafted in the first round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies with the 17th overall selection.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$60 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>During the next two seasons, however, Hamels suffered through several injuries, and pitched only sparingly.

Cole Hamels celebrates birthday on December 27 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In May 2006, Hamels made his major league debut for the Phillies. After securing a long-term spot as a member of the Phillies starting rotation in his rookie season, he made large strides in the 2007 Major League Baseball season and won the Phillies’ top major league pitcher award. Hamels was both the top pitcher on the team entering the 2008 season, as well as during the Phillies’ postseason run, during which they ultimately won the 2008 World Series over the Tampa Bay Rays; he won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. After the 2008 season, Hamels signed a three-year contract with the Phillies. His statistics declined over the next two seasons, struggling through a tumultuous 2009 campaign and somewhat bouncing back in 2010 — however, still not approaching his 2008 numbers. Over the next few seasons, Hamels was joined by fellow All-Star pitchers Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, and Roy Oswalt. Hamels flourished alongside them, putting up some of his top career seasons before suffering from poor run support in 2013. With the decline of his aging teammates, the team missed the postseason for the next few years, but he remained one of the Phillies’ consistent stars. Hamels was traded to the Texas Rangers in 2015, and he subsequently sparked their run to the AL West title that season. Hamels spent parts of four seasons with the Rangers, including an All-Star season in 2016, before being traded to the Cubs in 2018.</p><h3>Is Cole Hamels coming back?</h3><p>Philadelphia Phillies icon <b>Cole Hamels isn’t going to pitch in 2022</b>, but remains hopeful that his career will have another chapter.
