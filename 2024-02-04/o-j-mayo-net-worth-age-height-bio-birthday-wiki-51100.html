On July 5, 2006, it was reported by ESPN that he would attend USC. On July 8, however, WSAZ-TV reported that USC was only one of three colleges that Mayo was considering: the other two being Kansas State University and the University of Florida.</p><p align=justify>On March 9, 2007, Mayo and three other men were cited by the Cabell County Sheriff’s Department for misdemeanor simple possession of marijuana.
