Her portrayal of Emma was noted by film critic Tito Valiente of Business Mirror as “one reason the short life on that island becomes very real.” Valiente went on to note that De Castro’s character was “vulnerable but not whiny. Even in tears she conjures an image of a woman whose only way out of life is finding life in anything.” The film was a finalist at that year’s Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival, where De Castro received a Golden Screen Awards nomination in the Best Actress category. She also played a supporting role that year in the romantic film Batanes, alongside top GMA actress Iza Calzado, Taiwanese singer-actor Ken Chu, and Marky Cielo.
