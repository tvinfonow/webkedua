In the 200-metre event, American athletes earned the top four places, the first time any country had done so in World Championship athletics history.</p><p>In the fall of 2000, Gatlin arrived at University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as a good high school 110-metre hurdler. During high school, Gatlin was recruited for track by coaches Vince Anderson and Bill Webb who quickly realized his potential and turned him into a sprinter. After training and competing in Tennessee’s program for two years under the guidance of former assistant Vince Anderson, Gatlin won six consecutive NCAA titles. In the fall of 2004, Gatlin graduated from Tennessee after his four seasons to join the professional ranks. Just two years later, he won the gold medal in the 100 metres (9.85 seconds) at the 2004 Summer Olympics, narrowly beating Francis Obikwelu of Portugal and the defending champion Maurice Greene. He also won a bronze medal in an American sweep of the 200-metre race, and a silver medal as a member of the 4 × 100 metres relay squad. In the 2005 World Athletics Championships in Helsinki, he won gold in 100 metres from defending champion Kim Collins.</p><p align=justify>He was a high school sprinter and was raised in Brooklyn.&nbsp;The actor has one son who is named Jace.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Justin Gatlin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Justin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gatlin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Runner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1982</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Daynise Gatlin</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jace Gatlin</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Justin Gatlin ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
