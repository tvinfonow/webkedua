By the end of the decade, she auditioned for Hair and eventually moved to Berlin to join the German cast where she replaced Donna Summer. After Hair, Mitchell joined the Les Humphries Singers for a few years and represented Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest with the Ralph Siegel title “Sing Sang Song”. The band was then reduced to only six singers for the show (their usual line-ups consisted of 20 performers and up), and came in 15th place with only 12 points, which they regarded as their beginning of the end as a band.</p><p>“Got a Man on My Mind” was taken from Boney M.’s 1976 album Take the Heat Off Me. “Perfect” was a 1974 demo with Malcolm Magaron (despite the label crediting Farian as the producer).</p><p align=justify>She was born in Clarendon, Jamaica and raised in London, England.&nbsp;She co-founded Dove House Records with her husband Thomas Pemberton.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Liz Mitchell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Liz</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mitchell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Clarendon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jacinth Mitchell, Burnell Mitchell</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Thomas Pemberton</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Adero Pemberton</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Liz Mitchell ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Though she did not contribute significantly as a songwriter, Mitchell’s vocals are widely regarded as the most distinctive part of the Boney M. sound.</p><h2>Liz Mitchell Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Liz Mitchell is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from Jamaica.

A recording contract for the group was also arranged. When Farrell and the replacement singer failed to show up for the rehearsals, Mitchell and Williams recruited singer Celena Duncan and dancer Curt Dee Daran for the tour. As Williams had never sung on Boney M.’s recordings, Mitchell ended up recording the scheduled album on her own.</p><p>However, it proved difficult for Mitchell to find a record label to release the album, entitled No One Will Force You. It was released in Spain in the Autumn of 1988, supported by the singles “Mandela” (a re-work of Boney M.’s 1979 hit “El Lute”) and “Niños De La Playa” (Children of the Beach). The latter was also released on Mega Records in Scandinavia where the group did a tour in October.

Though the group’s initial purpose was simply to lip-synch for TV and discothèque performances of Farian’s song “Baby Do You Wanna Bump”, Boney M. soon became a legitimate recording group with Mitchell, Marcia Barrett, and producer Farian as the vocal core. Mitchell became widely regarded as Boney M.’s lead vocalist. Farian later stated that “All members (of Boney M.) could be replaced, except Liz”.</p><p align=justify>In 1990, Mitchell re-formed her 1988 line-up with Patricia Foster replacing Celena Duncan and kept touring the cabaret circuit. In April 1991, she released the single “Mocking Bird”, produced by longtime Boney M. collaborator, Helmut Rulofs to minimal attention. After three dire years, the success of Boney M. Gold – 20 Super Hits boosted the career of her line-up, entitled ‘Boney M. feat. Liz Mitchell’, and they were officially approved by Farian to promote the album and the accompanying singles. For the follow-up More Gold – 20 Super Hits Vol. II, Mitchell recorded four new songs. No One Will Force You with two previously unreleased tracks from 1984 was also re-released in Denmark, five years after it was recorded.</p><h2>Who is Liz Mitchell Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Liz Mitchell</strong> married to <strong>Thomas Pemberton </strong>.
