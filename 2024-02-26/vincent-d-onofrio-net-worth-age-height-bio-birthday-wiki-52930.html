He is known for his supporting and leading roles in both film and television. He has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Saturn Awards, winning one for his supporting role in Men in Black.</p><p>In 1984, he made his Broadway debut as Nick Rizzoli in Open Admissions. In 1986, D’Onofrio took on the role often considered the defining moment in his acting career, as Pvt. Leonard Lawrence, an overweight, clumsy Marine recruit in the movie Full Metal Jacket. On a tip from friend Matthew Modine, D’Onofrio was urged to send audition tapes to director Stanley Kubrick, in England. Four tapes later, D’Onofrio landed the role. Originally, the character of Pvt. Lawrence had been written as a “skinny ignorant redneck”; however, Kubrick believed the role would have more impact if the character were big and clumsy. D’Onofrio gained 5 stone / 70&nbsp;lb (32&nbsp;kg) for the role, bringing his weight to 20 stone / 280&nbsp;lb (130&nbsp;kg). This remains the record for most weight gained by an actor for a film. While filming an obstacle course scene for the movie, D’Onofrio injured his left knee, compounded by the excessive weight, which required surgical reconstruction.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vincent D'Onofrio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Facundo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Almada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bensonhurst</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Carin van der Donk</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Leila George, Elias Gene D'Onofrio, Luka D'Onofrio</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Vincent D'Onofrio ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
