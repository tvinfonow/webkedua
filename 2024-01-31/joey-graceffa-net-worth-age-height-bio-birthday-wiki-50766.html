His book was a New York Times Best Seller on the “Young Adult Hardcover” list in the week of October 23, 2016. The book has received positive reactions from readers on Goodreads and Amazon, with four and five star reviews predominating. Critics have not been universally positive, although Rachel Hyland of Geek Speak Magazine wrote, “Graceffa knows a lot about YA dystopian conventions, and they are all present and accounted for here. This is by no means a bad thing — an enjoyable romp through this genre doesn’t necessarily require too much divergence (no pun intended) from the established norms — but it is worth noting that most everything in his Eden has pretty much happened before, in one way or another. Still, it is fun to see just how those ever-trusty elements are put together, and there is a nice twist on the almost essential love triangle that is actually pretty awesome.”</p><h3>What disease does Joey Graceffa have?</h3><p>He’s talked before about his ongoing struggles with <b>thrush</b>, an infection that usually strikes when a person’s immunity is down.
