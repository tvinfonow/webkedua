Travis Ford (born December 29, 1969) is an American college basketball coach, who is currently the head coach of the Saint Louis Billikens men’s basketball team. He was also previously the head coach at Campbellsville University, Eastern Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma State. Prior to that, he played at the University of Missouri and the University of Kentucky.</p><p>In 2000, Ford accepted the head coaching position at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Kentucky. In five seasons at EKU, Ford led the Colonels from a 7–19 record his first year to a 22–9 record and an Ohio Valley Conference championship in 2005. In a much publicized first-round NCAA Tournament matchup with his alma mater, the University of Kentucky, Ford’s team pushed the Wildcats to the limit before losing 72–64.</p><p>After the 2004–05 season, Ford accepted the head coaching position at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During his first season, 2005–06, with the Minutemen, Ford posted a 13–15 record, 8–8 in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The 2006–07 season saw Ford coach UMass to the fifth most wins in school history with an overall mark of 24–9. The team shared the Atlantic 10 Conference regular season title with Xavier, going 13–3, but lost to Saint Louis in the second round of the Atlantic 10 tournament. After earning a #4 seed in the postseason National Invitation Tournament, UMass defeated Alabama before losing in the second round to eventual NIT champion West Virginia. The team featured Atlantic 10 Player of the Year Stéphane Lasme. After the season ended, Ford’s name was circulated as a long-shot replacement for the head coaching position at Ford’s alma mater, the University of Kentucky. These rumors were put to rest when after the season on April 10, 2007, UMass announced that Ford had signed a five-year contract extension.</p><p>On April 16, 2008, Oklahoma State hired Ford to become the head basketball coach. In his first season, Ford led the Cowboys to a 23–12 overall record, with a 9–7 record in conference. He led Oklahoma State to its first NCAA Tournament appearance since the 2004–05 season. In the tournament, Oklahoma State beat Tennessee before being knocked off by Pittsburgh in the second round. In year two, Ford’s Cowboys finished 22–11, 9–7 in conference. The year was highlighted by wins over a top ten Kansas State on the road and a home win over #1 ranked Kansas. Big 12 player of the year James Anderson was instrumental in both wins and became Travis Ford’s first Cowboy to be selected in the first round of the NBA Draft.</p><p align=justify>After an unsuccessful attempt at an NBA career, Ford landed the role of Danny O’Grady in the 1997 movie The 6th Man, starring Marlon Wayans and Kadeem Hardison.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Travis Ford</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Travis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Travis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Madisonville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Madisonville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Pat Ford, Eddie Ford</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Heather Ford</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brooks Ford, Shane Ford, Kyleigh Ford</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Travis Ford ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He inherited a Billikens team that had gone a disappointing 11-21 each of the previous two seasons under head coach Jim Crews. Due to a lack of talent from the previous regime, SLU was predicted to finish dead last of the Atlantic 10 conference during the 2016–17 season. Basketball statistician Ken Pomeroy predicted the Billikens as the team most likely to go winless throughout its conference schedule. Ford led the Billikens to six Atlantic 10 conference wins and a 12-21 overall record.</p><h2>Travis Ford Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Travis Ford is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States.
