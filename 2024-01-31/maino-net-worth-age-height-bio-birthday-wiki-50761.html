By the early 1990s, Maino found himself in the middle of a “drug related kidnapping,” that led to a 5-to-15 years prison sentence: “We didn’t really know what we were doing,” he recalls. “We had a great idea, I guess, but we wound up getting caught.” During his decade-long prison term, Maino began rapping as a result of boredom: “I’d be in the box for twenty-three hours a day, I just started rapping as something to do. I feel like hip hop kept me alive.” While listening to DJ Clue mixtapes featuring some of “Brooklyn’s Finest” – Notorious B.I.G, Jay-Z, Lil’ Kim – the vibe only got stronger. Maino adopted the “no writing” technique of emceeing: “I was never comfortable writing my raps down.” Upon his release in 2003, Maino immediately launched independent record label Hustle Hard Entertainment. After several mixtape releases and key guest features, in 2005 Maino was offered a recording contract by Universal Records. Maino split with the label in 2007.</p><p>In 2008, Maino later signed himself and his Hustle Hard imprint to Atlantic Records. He then began working on his debut album, If Tomorrow Comes…. His commercial debut single, titled “Hi Hater,” was released in April 2008. Maino later released the song’s official remix, featuring fellow American rappers T.I., Swizz Beatz, Plies, Jadakiss and Fabolous. The album’s second single was “All the Above,” featuring T-Pain. “All the Above” is Maino’s first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It debuted at #54 and then rose to #39 the next week. It also had peaked at #10 on the Hot Rap Tracks, #59 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and #46 on the Pop 100. The single is certified platinum and is Maino’s only Top 40 hit to date. The album’s third single “Million Bucks,” features vocals and production from Swizz Beatz. If Tomorrow Comes… debuted at number 25 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 18,000 copies in the United States. In 2008, Maino also crafted an original song titled “Getaway Driver”, for the Grand Theft Auto IV video game.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maino</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daryl</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Williams</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Maino ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
