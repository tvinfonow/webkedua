He was the winner of the 1983 PGA Championship and 10 PGA Tours.&nbsp;He was named PGA Player of the year in 1983, and Comeback Player of the year in 1994.</p><p>He was awarded the 2006 Charlie Bennett Award to recognize philanthropic contributions with fellow Louisianans Kelly Gibson and&nbsp;He shared the 2006 Charlie Bennett Award, given to honor philanthropic contributions, with fellow Louisianans, Kelly Gibson and <a href=#>David Toms</a>..</p><p>Born and raised in Shreveport, Louisiana, Sutton was a promising player at its Centenary College, and was named Golf Magazine’s 1980 College Player of the Year. At Centenary, Sutton won 14 golf tournaments, was an All American, led the Gents to the NCAA Tournament, and finished ninth nationally. He quickly established himself as one of the PGA Tour’s top young stars in the early 1980s. His first win was at the 1982 Walt Disney World Golf Classic in a playoff with Bill Britton after the two had tied at 19-under-par 269 after 72 holes.</p><p>Sutton’s most notable year came in 1983, when he won the Tournament Players Championship in March, followed by his only major title, the PGA Championship at Riviera in August. He entered into a long drought shortly thereafter, going from 1987 to 1994 without a PGA Tour victory. He nearly lost his tour card late in the string, maintaining it only by using a one-time-only exemption for players in the top 50 of the all-time PGA Tour career money list. After this disappointing eight years, Sutton rejuvenated his career in 1995 with a win at the B.C. Open.</p><p align=justify>He was raised in Shreveport Louisiana.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hal Sutton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sutton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Golfer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shreveport</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Louisiana</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Howard Sutton, Mary Sutton</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Stacy Sutton</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Holt Sutton, Samantha Jean, Sara Rias, Sadie Ann</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Hal Sutton ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
