She then returned to UCL in 1987 to start a PhD with “Nitrogen metabolism in carrot cell cultures” which she completed in 1990. After graduating, she held postdoctoral positions at Duke University in the US (1991) and the School of Biological Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra (1992-1995).</p><p>Robinson was made the inaugural lecturer in plant physiology at the University of Wollongong in 1996, and became a Senior Professor in 2016. She is a plant ecophysiologist and climate change biologist. Her research examines how plants respond to climate change with an integrated systems approach using molecular to ecological techniques. Throughout her career she has pioneered novel techniques to investigate metabolic processes in vivo and has expertise in plant nitrogen metabolism, respiration, photosynthesis and photoprotective mechanisms (both for visible and ultraviolet (UV) radiation). One of her career highlights was demonstrating a role for the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase in nitrogen mobilisation. Some of her most impactful work has been in developing on-line mass spectrometry methods to measure the pathways that contribute to plant respiration, which has enabled assessment plant stress physiology and thermoregulation.</p><p align=justify>Although she was a born and raised in San Francisco, she later moved to Los Angeles, California.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sharon Robinson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sharon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robinson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Francisco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sharon Robinson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
