Notts County had drawn the first leg of the play-off semi-final at Middlesbrough. In the second leg, following an injury to Phil Turner, Harding, who had played as a striker with Enfield, moved out of midfield to play in attack. Within minutes, he headed the only goal of the game, the first he had scored since joining the club. He appeared in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium, though only briefly, as an 81st-minute substitute. After the semi-final, Harding told the press that “turning pro with Notts County was a big gamble for me. But now I know that it was worth it.”</p><p>Harding was born in Mitcham, Surrey. He began his football career as an apprentice with Chelsea, but did not progress to the first team, and worked as a bricklayer, playing part-time for a number of non-league clubs in the Surrey and south London area before joining Enfield of the Conference National, with whom he won the FA Trophy in 1988. In February 1990 he moved to Conference runners-up Barnet, and in September of the same year he and teammate Dave Regis signed for Notts County, newly promoted to the Football League Second Division.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul Harding</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Igor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Zubkovsky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American musician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mitcham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Australia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Australia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Paul Harding ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
