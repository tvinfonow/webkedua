That is the landscape of this album.” The album was noted for Rudolf’s distinctive merging of musical styles, namely, rock and hip-hop. “It’s about taking rock attitude vocally, hip hop drums, synths, and guitars and sharpening the edges of everything in a sense.

After relocating to Los Angeles in 2010 while writing and producing for several artists, Rudolf returned to New York for a brief time in 2012 to begin work on his upcoming album. He missed living in Miami and later that year made it his permanent residence. In the documentary Ferraris and Helicopters, Rudolf explained his attraction to the city. “When I moved down to Miami it was like moving to another planet because I was so used to New York, the energy and the craziness and everything. I came down here, I really didn’t know too many people. I would go to this place called the Greek Place for breakfast, and I sort of found myself sitting up at the bar talking to the old retirees, South American people, Orthodox Jews-and the local Floridians, and it became part of my daily life. I don’t know how it happened. I just started hanging out and having conversations. I still talk to all those people, a lot of them when I go back there. It’s cool because it gave me the feeling of a hometown rooting for you. Because I grew up in New York, and it’s not really that hometown rooting for you kind of thing, it’s more like everybody’s just trying to do their own thing.”</p><h3>Where did Kevin Rudolf go?</h3><p>He spent a few years in Nashville, where he co-wrote and played on Keith Urban’s “Little Bit of Everything,” before moving back to <b>Miami</b>, where he’s renewing his artist career with “I Will Not Break.”</p><h3>Is Kevin Rudolf still with Cash Money?</h3><p>2015–present: Space Rock <b>After being relaxed out of his record deal with Cash Money Records in January 2015</b>, Rudolf could no longer release music under his own name for a period of three years, therefore Rudolf created a new project under the alias Space Rock.</p><h3>Does Kevin Rudolf have kids?</h3><p>Since we last met up at this same spot in 2008, Kevin has lived in Los Angeles, New York City, and Nashville.
