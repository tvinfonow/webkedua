Initially a backing musician for Dottie West, he also worked with Bob Luman and Chet Atkins before beginning a solo career in the late 1970s. He has released eighteen studio albums and over fifty singles for several different record labels.</p><p>Wariner also began writing songs at this point, and West attempted to secure him a record label contract by submitting demos of his work, but was unsuccessful. He then left West’s road band to put a greater focus on songwriting, and began touring with Bob Luman after he cut some of Wariner’s songs. While in recording sessions with Luman, Wariner encountered guitarist Paul Yandell, who was also working for Atkins at the time. Yandell submitted some of Wariner’s demos to Atkins, who was also vice-president of RCA Records Nashville at the time and was thus able to sign Wariner to a contract in 1976.</p><p align=justify>Sons Ross and Ryan both play guitar on one of Wariner’s albums.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steve Warriner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steve</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Warriner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Noblesville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Indiana</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Roy Wariner, Ilene Wariner</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Terry Wariner, David Wariner, Barbara Judd, Kenny Wariner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Caryn Wariner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>2</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Steve Warriner ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

As a teenager, Wariner taught himself how to play several instruments, including acoustic guitar, bass guitar, drums, banjo, and steel guitar. Wariner performed locally in his father Roy Wariner’s band, drawing influence from musical acts his father listened to such as George Jones and Chet Atkins. When Wariner was 17, country singer Dottie West heard him performing at a nightclub in Indianapolis and recruited him to play bass guitar in her road band. Wariner completed his education through a correspondence course with his local high school, and went on to play in West’s band for three years; he also played on her 1973 single “Country Sunshine”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that “in the beginning, the low-tuned guitars and wide range of his singles brought frequent comparisons to the early Glen Campbell hits.” Richard Carlin of Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary similarly compared the RCA catalog to that of Glen Campbell, calling such songs “a pop-country backup that really wasn’t suited to him”. Carlin found the MCA albums more “progressive” and comparable to pop rock. Thomas Goldsmith of The Tennessean noted that many of Wariner’s mid-1980s hit singles were “personal, down-to-earth songs of daily life.” He also wrote that by the release of Life’s Highway, Wariner had developed a “leaner country style” compared to the “pop-oriented tunes” of his earlier days. In a review of Faith in You also for AllMusic, Ruhlmann described Wariner’s style by saying, “his abilities as a guitarist, understated but always apparent in the style of his mentor, Chet Atkins, provide a basic level of enjoyment no matter what else is going on.” Brian Wahlert of Country Standard Time stated that “most of the time he releases pleasant music that is neither inoffensive nor exciting.” Writing for the Dallas Morning News, Jay Brakefield contrasted Wariner’s style with that of Vince Gill, saying that “like Gill, Wariner has a reputation as a superb guitar player and a teriffic vocalist.” Wariner noted that Atkins was influential in his early days as a recording artist, as Atkins encouraged Wariner to play his own lead guitar parts, and to emphasize the quality of a song over who wrote it. Despite this, Wariner also said that he only chose to include his own guitar solos on songs where he felt that they were necessary. Some of Wariner’s songs employ scat singing over his solos, most notably “I Got Dreams”.</p><p>His first major chart hit came in 1980 when “Your Memory” ascended to the number seven position on the country charts. Due to the song’s success, Atkins fired Wariner from his band. “Your Memory” was the first of six singles from his self-titled debut album. After it came his first number-one single, 1981’s “All Roads Lead to You”, followed by the top 15 hit “Kansas City Lights”. Both of these songs were written by Kye Fleming and Dennis Morgan. The album’s last two singles, “Don’t It Break Your Heart” and “Don’t Plan on Sleeping Tonight”, fared less successfully on the charts. Al Campbell of AllMusic stated that Wariner’s “sophisticated country-pop sound was already perfected, and it showed by the quality of the material.” In 1980, the Academy of Country Music nominated Wariner for Top New Male Vocalist.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Steve Warriner height</b> Not available right now.

It peaked at number 63 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in 1978. This was followed by five more chart singles, none of which appeared on an album at the time due to their limited success. These singles were primarily covers of songs by other artists, including Charley Pride’s “The Easy Part’s Over”. Record World magazine published a positive review of this cover, which stated that it was a “slow, sad ballad” in which “Wariner contnues to show a whole lotta vocal talent.” Atkins also hired Wariner to be a bassist in his road band, which led to a nomination by the Academy of Country Music for Bassist of the Year in 1979. Also, Atkins served as his record producer on his first single releases, but later encouraged him to find a different one. As a result, “The Easy Part’s Over” was instead produced by Tom Collins, known for also producing Ronnie Milsap and Sylvia.</p><p align=justify>RCA released his second studio album Midnight Fire in 1983. Tony Brown and Norro Wilson co-produced the album except for the last two tracks, for which Collins stayed on as producer. Contributing songwriters included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, Jerry Fuller, and Richard Leigh. The closing track was a duet with Barbara Mandrell on a cover of Mickey Gilley’s 1975 hit “Overnight Sensation”, which also appeared on Mandrell’s 1983 album Spun Gold. Wariner said that he chose to switch producers as a means of introducing more uptempo material, and both Wilson and Brown were working for RCA at the time. The lead single “Don’t Your Memory Ever Sleep at Night” faltered on the country charts, but the title track was more successful, reaching a peak of number five. Following this was a cover of Luman’s 1972 hit “Lonely Women Make Good Lovers”, which in early 1984 matched the original version’s Hot Country Songs peak of number four. The album’s next two singles, “Why Goodbye” and “Don’t You Give Up on Love”, were less successful. Joy Lynn Stewart of the Red Deer Advocate praised Wariner’s “fine, textured vocals” along with the combination of upbeat songs and ballads.</p><h2>Who is Steve Warriner Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Steve Warriner</strong> married to <strong>Caryn Wariner</strong>.

While on these labels he sent a number of singles into the top ten of the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts and received favorable critical reception for the amount of creative control he held over his body of work. Upon moving to Arista Nashville in 1991 he had his most commercially successful album I Am Ready, his first to be certified gold, but followups were less successful. After a period of commercial downfall, he experienced a second wave of success in the late 1990s, spurred by co-writing the number-one singles “Longneck Bottle” by Garth Brooks and “Nothin’ but the Taillights” by Clint Black. These songs led to him signing with Capitol Records Nashville and achieving two more gold albums with Burnin’ the Roadhouse Down and Two Teardrops by decade’s end. While his commercial success once again dwindled after these albums, he has continued to record independently on his own SelecTone label.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Steve Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Singer</strong>.

Steve Warriner celebrates birthday on December 25 of every year.</p><p align=justify>When Wariner’s contract ended in 1984, he chose to follow Brown to MCA Nashville. His first album for the label was 1985’s One Good Night Deserves Another, which Brown co-produced with Jimmy Bowen. The album included three singles: the top-ten hits “What I Didn’t Do” and “Heart Trouble”, and his second number-one hit “Some Fools Never Learn”. The Academy of Country Music nominated “Some Fools Never Learn” for Song of the Year in 1985, and Wariner later remarked that he considered it his favorite single. In the process of making the album, Wariner said that Brown and Bowen allowed him more control in the creative process than previous producers, by asking him to find his own material and then explain to them why he liked each song that he had chosen. The song selection process also allowed for a number of songwriters not typically found on albums of the era. These writers included Dave Gibson, Ronnie Rogers, Wood Newton, Paul Overstreet, and Steve Earle. Stewart wrote that “Wariner takes a fresh approach to traditional country and melds a unique, winning style”, highlighting the ballad “You Can’t Cut Me Any Deeper” and the “grand pace” of “Your Love Has Got a Hold on Me” in particular.</p>You may read full biography about Steve Warriner from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfqMGmwsRmrpqqmaOys3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=/2024-02-19/suzan-lori-parks-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-52385.html>&#171;&nbsp;Suzan-Lori Parks Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a>
