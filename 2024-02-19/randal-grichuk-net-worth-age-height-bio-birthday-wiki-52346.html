First, he tore a ligament after just 12 games in 2010. Second, he batted a foul ball that fractured his knee cap. Finally, while diving for a ball, he broke his wrist. In 2012, his first full season, Grichuk played 135 games and batted .298 with 18 home runs and 71 runs batted in with the Class-A Inland Empire 66ers.

For what he lacks in the classic speed of center fielders, he mitigates with robust jumps and precise route running and positioning to easily anticipate the trajectory of – and catch – balls hit to the outfield. His arm strength and range allow him the ability to cut off runners at times from extra bases on the occasional plays for which he did not properly position himself.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Randal Grichuk height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Randal <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Grichuk attended Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, Texas.
