In one of her sideline reports during the first half she mentioned Missouri quarterback Chase Daniel’s frustration due to Missouri being stymied by the Oklahoma defense, saying Daniel was “upset” and “fuming.” However, a technical blunder caused Salters’ microphone to be broadcast over the stadium’s PA system.
