Rex Grossman, then the team’s starting quarterback, claimed Davis was one of the team’s hardest workers in the 2006 offseason. Despite being overshadowed by more experienced wide receivers like Muhsin Muhammad, Bernard Berrian, and Mark Bradley, he proceeded to stun critics and skeptics by emerging as one of the Bears’ most productive assets in the 2006 preseason, including a 100-yard touchdown return on August 18, 2006.

Davis caught a career-high 35 passes, for 445 yards and 2 touchdowns. At one point during the 2008 season, the Bears were prepared to use Davis as a reserve cornerback due to several injuries in their secondary. During the 2009 preseason, Davis was locked in fierce competition with Devin Aromashodu and Brandon Rideau for a spot on the team’s final 53-man roster. Despite only catching three passes during the entire preseason, Davis, a key special teams contributor, beat out Rideau for the final wide receiver spot. Davis only recorded five receptions during the entire 2009 season, and spent most of his time on special teams. Davis continued to be a regular member of the Bears special teams in 2010. He finished the 2010 season with nine receptions, for 84 yards and one touchdown.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Rashied Davis height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Rashied <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite his success in the AFL, Davis ventured into the National Football League in hopes of finding a new career.
