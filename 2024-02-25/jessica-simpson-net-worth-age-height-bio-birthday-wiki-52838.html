She went through a “carefully orchestrated sexy makeover” while promoting her second album, Irresistible (2001).

She attempted to launch her career as a Christian music singer, and at one point completed a self-titled album of Christian music. When she signed with Columbia Records in 1998, she began working on an album of pop music. Simpson has recorded songs with Christian themes in later years, including “Pray Out Loud” (2008). The music found on her debut album primarily consisted of pop ballads, with the intention of showcasing Simpson’s vocals. AllMusic’s Stephen Thomas Erlewine opined that the album “position[ed] her as the teen Celine Dion”. Most notably, it featured the power ballad “I Wanna Love You Forever” (1999). The music found on her debut drew comparisons to Mariah Carey. With the release of Irresistible (2001), Simpson recorded more upbeat songs, likening herself to artists such as Britney Spears. Songs such as “Irresistible” and “A Little Bit” had more provocative lyrics in comparison to her previous release, with Simpson citing the age difference between the recording of the two albums as the main reason. During the Total Request Live Tour (2001) and her DreamChaser Tour (2001), Simpson incorporated more choreography and backup dancers into her live performances.</p><h2>Jessica Simpson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jessica Simpson is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States.

She is the first child of Tina Ann Simpson (née Drew), a homemaker, and Joseph “Joe” Simpson, a psychologist and Baptist youth minister. Simpson’s parents married in 1978; they divorced in 2013.

Mottola wanted Simpson to embrace an “anti-sex appeal” image while promoting the record, as a contrast to highly successful artists Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. He believed the image would make Simpson more “relatable” to listeners, therefore aiding in sales. Simpson went on to announce her plans to remain abstinent until marriage as a result of Mottola’s decision. Her debut single, “I Wanna Love You Forever” (1999), was released on September 28. The single became a success in numerous territories, most notably reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. The song earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one million copies in the country. The album had some success in other territories as well, most notably in several European countries.</p><p>Her debut album, Jessica, remained unreleased after Proclaim Records went bankrupt; despite this, her grandmother personally funded a limited pressing of the album. Shortly after this, Simpson landed several auditions as Jessica was sent to numerous labels and producers. She ultimately caught the attention of Tommy Mottola, then-husband of Mariah Carey and the head of Columbia Records. He went on to sign her to the label, claiming “She had a great little look and a great attitude, a fresh new face, and something a bit different than Britney and all of them; she could actually sing.” Simpson began working on her debut album in Orlando, Florida. Mottola hoped to market Simpson as a contrast to Spears and Aguilera, both of whom had launched successful careers focused on dancing and sexuality. While working on her musical debut, Simpson enlisted her father Joe as her manager; her mother became her stylist. While at a Christmas party in 1998, Simpson met 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey, and the two began a romantic relationship; Lachey claimed that he left the party and proclaimed to his mother that he would marry Simpson some day.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jessica Simpson height</b> <strong>5 ft 3 in</strong> Jessica <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>She began singing in the church choir as a child. When she was eleven, she realized she hoped to achieve success as a singer while at a church retreat. Simpson auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club at the age of twelve, auditioning with a performance of “Amazing Grace” and dancing to “Ice Ice Baby” (1990). She advanced through multiple rounds, eventually being a semi-finalist for the show alongside artists such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake. Simpson claimed that she became nervous about her final audition after seeing Aguilera perform, and she ultimately was not selected for the show. Simpson resumed performing in her church choir, eventually being discovered by the head of a Christian music label. He initially asked her for an audition, and immediately signed her after she performed “I Will Always Love You” (1973) by Dolly Parton. She began working on her debut album with Proclaim Records, and began touring to promote the project. Jessica’s father later claimed that she had to quit touring as the size of her breasts led to her being deemed too “sexual” for the genre.</p><p align=justify>Work on her second album began in 2000, opting to record more “radio-friendly” and upbeat songs for the record. During the recording of the album, Simpson adopted a more mature public image, a decision made by both Simpson and her record label in hopes to achieve the success of artists such as Spears. While working on the record, Simpson ended her relationship with Lachey to focus on furthering her career; the two would later reconcile in September. In a July 2001 interview with Coventry Newspapers, Simpson explained “I recorded [Sweet Kisses] when I was seventeen years old and I’m twenty-one [this month] so there is four years of growth involved.” Simpson released the record’s title track, “Irresistible” (2001) as the lead single from the project in April. The single received a generally mixed reaction from critics due to its sexual themes, though went on to become her second top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p><h2>Who is Jessica Simpson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jessica Simpson</strong> married to <strong>Eric Johnson , Nick Lachey </strong>.
