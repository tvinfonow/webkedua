Who is MC Eiht dating now & how much money does MC Eiht have?</p><h2>MC Eiht Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>MC Eiht</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Rapper</strong> who was born on <strong>May 22, 1971</strong> in Compton, California, <strong>United States</strong>. American rapper, best known for being the de facto leader and founder of West Coast hip-hop group Compton’s Most Wanted.&nbsp;He is also well-known for his part in Menace II Society.</p><p>He was seen in Menace II Society, starring&nbsp;Khandi.</p><p>MC Eiht and his group CMW got involved in a long tumultuous rivalry with fellow Compton DJ/rapper DJ Quik that lasted for several years. The feud traces back to a track on DJ Quik’s debut mixtape The Red Tape, where Quik indirectly dissed both Compton’s Most Wanted and N.W.A. During that time, Quik was a member to the Tree Top Piru Bloods and Eiht was a member of the 159th St. Tragniew Park Compton Crips. On the track “Duck Sick” from CMW’s debut album It’s a Compton Thang, they criticized and questioned Quik’s street credibility. They hit Quik again in 1991 on their second effort Straight Checkn ‘Em. Quik didn’t respond to CMW’s disses on his debut album Quik is the Name, but he responded to Eiht on the title track to his sophomore effort Way 2 Fonky. CMW responded months later with a music video for Def Wish II which featured a DJ Quik lookalike that was being chased and murdered by CMW. Quik didn’t respond to it as he was facing label problems and other music projects. However, on the soundtrack to the 1994 short film Murder Was The Case, on the track “Dollaz + Sense”, Quik ruthlessly verbally attacks Eiht, calling him a movie script killer (in reference to Eiht’s appearance in the critically acclaimed 1993 film Menace II Society), a coward, and more. Quik furthered the flames by performing the song at the 1995 Source Awards in New York City. The feud stayed quiet until April 1996, where Eiht responded to Quik on his second solo album Death Threatz. The feud between Quik and Eiht slowly died down in 1997 following the deaths of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., but the feud didn’t actually end until the summer of 2002, where Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger, and other West Coast rappers helped Eiht and Quik squash the beef. Since then, Quik and Eiht collaborated on various songs. Even though the rivalry was not on the level of the Nas-Jay Z rivalry or the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry since it was not covered by the media, it has been hailed by most hip hop fans and critics that it stands out as one of the longest active hip hop rivalries of all time (from 1992 to 1998).</p><p>Tyler was born in Compton, California and grew to fame on the West Coast as one of two MCs in the four-man crew, Compton’s Most Wanted. After enjoying increasing success with the group, which peaked with 1992’s Music to Driveby, Eiht took a role in the hit movie Menace II Society as well as a high-profile spot on the soundtrack. The song, “Streiht Up Menace,” which chronicles the unfortunate downturn of the film’s protagonist within the pathological conditions of American inner city life, is considered by many critics to be Eiht’s magnum opus. The movie spurred him into a solo career, although his next two albums We Come Strapped and Death Threatz would be accredited as MC Eiht featuring Compton’s Most Wanted. These albums were considered his best and took place during the most tense years of the ‘beef’ between Eiht and DJ Quik, Eiht’s childhood friends Boom Bam and Tha Chill of N.O.T.R were heavily involved with both albums and the Quik beef, there are several explicit remarks towards Quik made on these albums by E, Bam and Chill. E was also associated with W 159th St Tragniew Park Compton Crips.</p><p align=justify>He was raised in Compton, California with his family.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MC Eiht</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MC</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Eiht</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1971</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Compton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>MC Eiht ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
