And it cleansed me very early in my political evolution of any romanticism.” He later said: “I detested the extreme Left and extreme Right, and found myself somewhere in the middle.” The following year, after graduating from McGill, he studied as a Commonwealth Scholar in politics at Balliol College, Oxford, before returning to the United States to attend medical school at Harvard.</p><p align=justify>His wedding ceremony in 1974 with Robyn Krauthammer gave birth to a son who was named Daniel.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Charles Krauthammer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Charles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Krauthammer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Robyn Krauthammer</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Daniel Krauthammer</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Charles Krauthammer ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
