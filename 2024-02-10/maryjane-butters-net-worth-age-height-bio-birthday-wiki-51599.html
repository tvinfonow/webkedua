Working from her family farm in Moscow, Idaho, and through her websites, Butters has achieved success through a variety of business ventures relating to the domestic arts, organic farming, and a grassroots self-sufficiency movement directed at creating a rural revival.</p><p>In 1971, Butters graduated from Ben Lomond High School in Ogden, Utah. She worked at a short-lived secretarial job until she could find outdoor work. In 1972, Butters took a job in a mountaintop lookout tower in Weippe, Idaho, as a Clearwater-Potlatch Timber Protective Association fire watcher. When her job ended, she enrolled in the forestry program at Utah State University, but walked out in the middle of her art history course, never to return. In 1974, Butters became one of three women to be the first female wilderness rangers in the U.S., and she maintained trails and cleaned sheepherder camps in the Uinta Mountains of northern Utah. After that summer, she earned her carpentry proficiency certificate and was hired as the only woman on a crew building houses at Hill Air Force Base. Early in 1976, Butters became the first woman station guard at the Moose Creek Ranger Station, the most remote Forest Service District in the continental U.S. It was here that Butters met Emil Keck, the legendary fire-control officer and construction-crew chief who lived at the wilderness station year round. Keck became her mentor and the namesake for her second child. Butters has said of Keck, “He taught me how to work hard, and how to make work my life.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MaryJane Butters</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Masato</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kudo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Farmer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Utah</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>MaryJane Butters ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Butters called a public meeting to discuss an unsafe reactor similar to the one at Chernobyl at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in nearby eastern Washington. She founded the Palouse-Clearwater Hanford Watch and succeeded in having the reactor shut down. She then founded and became director of the Palouse Clearwater Environmental Institute, taking on broader issues like water quality and transportation. The group began to discuss and address agricultural issues as well, marking the beginning of her public activism for organic farming methods. Between 1986 and 1990, under her leadership, the Institute’s annual budget grew from $30 to $100,000 and garnered grants from national nonprofits. In 2011, PCEI celebrated their 25th anniversary of commitment to regional environmental issues.</p><h2>MaryJane Butters Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>MaryJane Butters is one of the <strong>richest Farmer</strong> from United States.

Her 1950s upbringing is often described as “unconventional” because the family raised their own food, made their own clothing, and “went nomadic on weekends, setting up camp in the wild to fish and hunt for their meat.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Farmer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1986, Butters responded to an ad for a remote, five-acre homestead and farmhouse at the base of Paradise Ridge in Moscow, Idaho. She eventually purchased the land sight-unseen for $45,000, and made the downpayment mostly from cash she’d kept in an old coffee can. The 1905 farmhouse burned down in a 1996 fire, forcing Butters and her children to move into an outbuilding until they could afford to rebuild. The farm continues to be the headquarters for Butters’ empire, and the site where her books, magazine, and websites are generated.</p><p>At a town meeting in 1989, Butters met a fellow farmer who grew organic, pest-resistant “desi” garbanzo beans that had proven to be unmarketable. Butters bought and experimented with the beans, eventually arriving at a dried falafel mix that she began to market under the Paradise Farm label in 1990. She began marketing other under-used organic crops and incorporated her food business in 1993 under the name “Paradise Farm Organics, Inc.” Today, she grosses over $1 million annually from her line of over 60 dried organic foods. Butters is the company’s president, and her husband, Nick Ogle, oversees production. In 1997, the company reached an agreement with Mountain Safety Research, a division of REI, to label and market her products. Butters’ food is now sold through her websites as well as through REI. Her backpacking line is also labeled in French and sold to stores across Canada by Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>MaryJane Butters height</b> Not available right now.

Their first child, Megan, was born In 1979, and four years later, on Emil Keck’s birthday, their son, Emil, was born. In 1986, she bought her remote, five-acre “Paradise Farm” in Idaho’s Palouse region. Her marriage ended in divorce shortly after, and Butters spent the next years raising her children on her own with no indoor plumbing, no television, and only wood heat. She supported the family on homegrown crops and a seamstress’, upholsterer’s, and carpenter’s salary.</p><p align=justify>In 1993, Butters married farmer Nick Ogle, whose 600 acres bordered Paradise Farm on two sides. The tracts of land were united, and Ogle oversees Butters’ dried-food business, Paradise Farm Organics, Inc.

Ogle, an official Universal Life Church minister, performed the marriage ceremonies for Brian, Emil, and Megan.
