After opening the season with a .431 batting average through 18 games with the Gulf Coast League Blue Jays, Bichette was placed on the 7-day disabled list after experiencing an injury to his midsection, which was later determined to be a ruptured appendix. He returned to the lineup shortly before the end of the season, and finished the year with a .427 batting average, four home runs, and 36 runs batted in (RBI) in 22 games. Despite missing more than half of the season with injury, Bichette was named the Gulf Coast League’s end-of-season All-Star at shortstop on September 13. During the offseason, he represented Brazil at the 2017 World Baseball Classic – Qualifier 4.</p><p>Bichette was assigned to the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts to begin the 2017 season.
