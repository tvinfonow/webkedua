Writer and director who made one of the most significant box office successes ever through Iron Man 3 in 2013.&nbsp;He started his career as a screenwriter, writing the action-comedy of 1987 Lethal Weapon.</p><p>He was the first director to direct&nbsp;He first directed <a href=#>Robert Downey Jr.</a> in 2005’s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.&nbsp;in the 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.</p><p>After living in the suburbs of Lower Burrell and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, his family moved to Fullerton, California, during his sophomore year of high school. There he attended Sunny Hills High School and later UCLA where he majored in film and theater and graduated in 1983. While Black had a long history writing comic strips, short stories, and journalism, only during his senior year did he decide to make a living from it once his classmate Fred Dekker showed him a science fiction script he did for an assignment. Black’s older brother Terry also wrote short stories and decided to move into screenplays starting with 1988’s Dead Heat, in which Shane has a cameo.</p><p>After graduating, Black worked as a typist for a temp agency, a data entry clerk for the 1984 Summer Olympics and an usher in a Westwood movie theater. Eventually he asked for financial support of his parents during the six-month development of a script, The Shadow Company, a supernatural thriller set in Vietnam. With Dekker’s help, the script landed him an agent and several lunch meetings with mid-level studio executives. This attracted 20th Century Fox executives, who were interested in having Black rewrite scripts. Eventually Black wrote an action film script, Lethal Weapon, in about six weeks, which landed him a $250,000 deal with Warner Bros. During the rewrites, Black asked producer Joel Silver for a small acting role in another film Silver was preparing at the time, Predator, a film for which Black also made uncredited contributions to the script. At the same time, Black helped Dekker write The Monster Squad, which along with Lethal Weapon and Predator came out in 1987. Since then, Black has acted in five additional films and in two episodes for the TV series Dark Justice.</p><p align=justify>The brother of his screenwriter is Terry Black.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shane Black</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shane</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Black</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Director</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pittsburgh</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Paul Black, Patricia Ann James</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Terry Black</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Shane Black ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

After two sabbatical years, Black decided to take on an old idea of his that emerged during the production of Lethal Weapon and turn it into a full screenplay. The result, The Last Boy Scout, earned him $1.75 million in 1991. Black would also earn $1 million for his rewrite of Last Action Hero in 1993. He would set a record by receiving $4 million for writing The Long Kiss Goodnight in 1994.</p><h2>Shane Black Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Shane Black is one of the <strong>richest Director</strong> from United States.

He was also briefly attached by Warner Bros. in 2011, to direct a live-action American adaptation of the popular Japanese supernatural-thriller manga series Death Note, bringing his close collaborators Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry to write the screenplay, replacing Charley and Vlas Parlapanides as the project’s previous screenwriters. However, by 2014, he had quietly left the project, due to reported creative differences and other commitments. The studio had intended to omit “Shinigamis” (Japanese gods of death), who were originally present in the manga series, from the film’s storyline, and revamp the main character: Light Yagami, into a more benevolent and sympathetic protagonist and change the story’s moral theme of justice into one of vengeance, which Black had opposed, who intended to create a more faithful adaptation of the original manga. Adding to that, he decided to focus more on his Doc Savage and Predator projects, which resulted in his absence from the project’s later developments and horror director Adam Wingard being eventually hired to helm the project by 2015. He left Doc Savage in 2020.</p><p align=justify>Black hired his friend, Steven Wilder Striegel, for a minor, un-auditioned role in The Predator (as well as, previously, Iron Man 3 and The Nice Guys). Striegel spent six months in prison in 2010, having pleaded guilty to risk of injury to a child and enticing a minor by computer after he had attempted to lure a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship via email. Black defended this decision and his friend until backlash forced him to later rescinding those comments. Olivia Munn, an actress in The Predator, insisted on having a scene with Striegel removed. Black released an apology publicly.</p><h2>Who is Shane Black Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Shane Black</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
