Republican politician who was the United States Senator from Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013. During his 2009 campaign for the Senate it was famously revealed that he had a prolific career as a model in the 1980’s and even posed nude for a Cosmopolitan centerfold in 1982.</p><p>He supported the troop “surge” in Afghanistan, basing his views on the recommendations of the top general in Afghanistan, <a href=#>Stanley McChrystal</a>.</p><p>Scott Philip Brown (born September 12, 1959) is an American diplomat, attorney and politician serving as the United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. He is a former United States Senator for Massachusetts (2010–2013), and also was the 2014 Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire. Prior to his Senate tenure, Brown served as a member of the Massachusetts General Court, first in the State House of Representatives (1998–2004) and then in the State Senate (2004–2010).</p><p>Brown’s opponents in the general election were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year’s season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.</p><p align=justify>He had two children with wife Gail Huff, a former TV news reporter.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scott Brown</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scott</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brown</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kittery, ME</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gail Huff (m. 1986)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ayla Brown, Arianna Brown</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Scott Brown ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
