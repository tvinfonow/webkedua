Sergei Konstantinovich Krikalev (Russian: Sergei Konstantinovich Krikaliov , also transliterated as Sergei Krikalyov; born August 27 28th, 1958) is a Russian mechanical engineer and cosmonaut.&nbsp;As an eminent rocket scientist, the veteran has been on six space missions and ranks third after Gennady Padalka, and Yuri Malenchenko for the amount of time spent in space, 803 days and 9 hours as well as 39 mins.&nbsp;Famous for his time on the Mir in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, he retired from space flight at the end of 2007 and was now serving as vice-president for Space Corporation Energia.</p><p>Krikalev was chosen as a cosmonaut during 1985 and completed his initial training in 1986 and for a brief period it was placed in the Buran Shuttle program.&nbsp;In the beginning of 1988, he started training for his first long-duration flight with the Mir space station.</p><p>Krikalev was in space when the Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26, 1991. With the Baikonur Cosmodrome and the landing area both being located in the newly-independent Kazakhstan, there was a lot of uncertainty about the fate of his mission. He remained in space for two times longer than originally planned, spending a total of 311 days in space. He returned to Earth on March 25, 1992 after being replaced by German astronaut Klaus-Dietrich Flade, and is sometimes referred to as the “last Soviet citizen”. These events are documented and contextualized in Romanian filmmaker Andrei Ujică’s 1995 documentary Out of the Present. A fictional account of how Krikalev may have felt about this is described in the song Casiopea, written by Cuban songwriter Silvio Rodríguez. Another fictional work inspired by Kiralev story is Sergio & Sergei, a 2017 film directed by Ernesto Daranas.</p><p>In July 1991, Krikalev agreed to stay on Mir as flight engineer for the next crew, scheduled to arrive in October because the next two planned flights had been reduced to one. The engineer slot on the Soyuz TM-13 flight on October 2, 1991, was filled by Toktar Aubakirov, an astronaut from the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, who had not been trained for a long-duration mission. Both he and Franz Viehböck, the first Austrian astronaut, returned with Artsebarsky on 10 October 1991. Commander Alexander Volkov remained on board with Krikalev. After the crew replacement in October, Volkov and Krikalev continued Mir experiment operations and conducted another EVA before returning to Earth on March 25, 1992.</p><p align=justify>He was a part in the Russian as well as Soviet national aerobatic flying teams. He was the Champion in Moscow in 1983. He also became the champion in the Soviet Union in 1986.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sergei Krikalev</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sergei</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Krikalev</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Astronaut</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Saint Petersburg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Russia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Yelena Terekhina</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Olga Sergeevna Krikaleva</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sergei Krikalev ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He served as a member of the team of rescuers formulating procedures for docking with the station that was not controlled and fixing the station’s onboard system.</p><p align=justify>This training included preparations for at least six EVAs (space walks), installation of a new module, the first test of the new Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and the second joint Soviet-French science mission. Soyuz TM-7 was launched on November 26, 1988, with Krikalev as flight engineer, Commander Alexander Volkov, and French astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien. The previous crew (Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov, and Valeri Polyakov) remained on Mir for another 25 days, marking the longest period a six-person crew had been in orbit. After the previous crew returned to Earth, Krikalev, Polyakov, and Volkov continued to conduct experiments aboard the Mir station. Because arrival of the next crew had been delayed, they prepared the Mir for a period of unmanned operations before returning to Earth on April 27, 1989.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Astronaut</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Krikalev flew on STS-60, the first joint U.S./Russian Space Shuttle Mission.

During the eight-day flight, the crew of Discovery conducted a wide variety of materials science experiments, both on the Wake Shield Facility and in the Spacehab, earth observation, and life science experiments. Krikalev conducted significant portions of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) operations during the flight. Following 130 orbits of the Earth in 3,439,705 nautical miles (6,370,334&nbsp;km), STS-60 landed at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 11 February 1994. With the completion of this flight, Krikalev logged an additional eight days, seven hours, nine minutes in space.</p><p>Krikalev flew on STS-88 Endeavour (4–15 December 1998), the first International Space Station assembly mission. During the 12-day mission the Unity Module was mated with Zarya module. Two crew members performed three space walks to connect umbilicals and attach tools and hardware for use in future EVAs. The crew also performed IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) operations, and deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1 and SAC-A. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth in 283 hours and 18 minutes.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sergei Krikalev height</b> Not available right now.
