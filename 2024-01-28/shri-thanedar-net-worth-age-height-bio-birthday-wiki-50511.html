Thanedar had not held elective office before running for Governor of Michigan in 2017, so he did not have an official record as a Democrat. Campaign finance records show that Thanedar made 18 donations to Democratic campaigns and 1 donation to a Republican campaign prior to running for office. However, that one Republican donation, $2,300 to the Republican presidential campaign of John McCain, led to controversy that Thanedar may not be as progressive as he claimed. Political strategists who met with Thanedar before his 2018 campaign also claimed that Thanedar initially questioned whether he wanted to run as a Democrat or Republican in the gubernatorial race. Thanedar denied the claims, stating that he was being criticized by these strategists because he did not hire their firms. Thanedar also faced accusations that laboratory animals were abandoned at one of his former research facilities after that business was placed into receivership by Bank of America in 2010, claims that were denied by Thanedar and later reports.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Shri Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Indian entrepreneur</strong>.
