Martelly “sang playful, romantic numbers over a slow méringue beat called compas, the only music allowed under the Duvaliers.” After the 1991 Haitian coup d’état saw the expulsion of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, “Martelly opened a Pétion-Ville club called the Garage, where he entertained many of the coup’s main architects, including the much-feared chief of national police, Michel François, later convicted in absentia for massacring Aristide supporters.”</p><h2>Michel Martelly Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Michel Martelly is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from Haiti.

He is from Côte-de-fer, a commune located in the South East of Haiti. Martelly was one of Haiti’s best-known musicians for over a decade, going by the stage name Sweet Micky. For business and musical reasons, Martelly has moved a number of times between the United States and Haiti. When travelling to the United States, Martelly mostly stays in Florida. After his presidency, Martelly returned to his former band and sang a carnival meringue entitled “Bal Bannan nan” (Give Her the Banana), as a mocking response to Liliane Pierre Paul, a famous Haitian female journalist in Port-au-prince.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1992, Martelly played for free at a protest against the arrival of a UN representative charged with negotiating the return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide after the 1991 Haitian coup d’état. Martelly later explained “I did not want Aristide back… You want me to be a de facto [supporter of the coup]. I’m a de facto. It’s my right. It’s my country. I can fight for whatever I believe in.” After Jean-Bertrand Aristide had been restored to office, some former military officers, paramilitaries and secret police associated with the old regime were assassinated. In February 1995, a “hit list” of such individuals was circulated, and included Martelly’s name. After an individual on the list was murdered, Martelly’s wife warned him not to come back from his tour, and it was almost a year before he returned to Haiti. During this time he released a song, Prezidan, “an exuberant ditty that called for a president who played compas”. At the 1996 Carnival, to which Manno Charlemagne, the mayor of Port-au-Prince, invited him, Martelly dressed in a pink wig and bra. As Martelly explained, it was intended in part as a political statement:</p><p>In 1997, Martelly participated in “Knowledge is Power”, an HIV educational music video with a message about preventing the spread of HIV. His humanitarian work as the president of the Fondation Rose et Blanc, created by his wife Sophia and himself, to help the poor and disenfranchised of the country, was the basis for his choice as the Good Will Haitian Ambassador for the Protection of the Environment by the Haitian Government.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michel Martelly height</b> Not available right now.

Martelly popularized a “new generation” of compas with smaller bands relying on synthesizers and electronic instruments. From 1989 to 2008, Martelly recorded over a dozen studio albums and a number of live CDs. As a musician and club owner in Haiti in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Martelly became associated with the neo-Duvalierist Haitian military and police, including figures such as police chief Michel François, and he agreed with the 1991 Haitian coup d’état against Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In 1995, after Aristide had been restored to office, Martelly’s name appeared on a hit list of coup supporters, and he stayed away from Haiti for almost a year. During this time, he released a song, “Prezidan” (on the album Pa Manyen), “an exuberant ditty that called for a president who played compas”. However, he did not run for political office until 2010, when he became a candidate for President of Haiti.</p><p align=justify>In 2004, following the 2004 Haitian coup d’état against Aristide, Gérard Latortue, a friend of Martelly’s, became Prime Minister. At this time, Martelly was living in Florida but in 2007, he moved back to Haiti. In the process, when the mortgage/financial sector crashed, he defaulted on more than $1m in loans, losing 3 properties to foreclosure.</p><h2>Who is Michel Martelly Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Michel Martelly</strong> married to <strong>Sophia Martelly </strong>.
