Who is Phil McGraw dating now & how much money does Phil McGraw have?</p><h2>Phil McGraw Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Phil McGraw</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>College Student Personnel</strong> who was born on <strong>September 1, 1950</strong> in Vinita, Vinita, <strong>United States</strong>. McGraw was born in Vinita, Oklahoma, on September 1, 1950, the son of Joseph J. McGraw Jr. and his wife, Anne Geraldine “Jerry” (née Stevens). He grew up with two older sisters, Deana and Donna, and younger sister Brenda in the oilfields of North Texas where his father was an equipment supplier. During McGraw’s childhood, his family moved so his father could pursue a lifelong goal of becoming a psychologist.</p><p>During the process of annulling the marriage in 1973, McGraw met and began dating Robin Jo Jameson, whom he married in 1976. The couple have two children together, Jay McGraw and Jordan McGraw.</p><p>In 1983, McGraw and his father joined Thelma Box, a successful Texas businesswoman, in presenting “Pathways” seminars, “experience-based training which allows individuals to achieve and create their own results.” Critics claim that many of the “phrases and the terminology and the quaint sayings” used by McGraw on the Oprah and Dr. Phil shows were coined by Box and presented by McGraw in this seminar. McGraw admits that some of the material from Life Strategies, his first best-seller, is taken directly from the Pathways seminar. However, he has never mentioned Box or her contributions to his success in any of his books or TV shows. Eight years after joining Box, McGraw signed an agreement for the sale of his Pathways seminar stock for $325,000 without notifying either his father or Box of the impending sale. Box founded her own seminars titled “Choices.”</p><p>On October 21, 1988, the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists determined that McGraw had hired a former patient for “part-time temporary employment”. Specifically, the board cited “a possible failure to provide proper separation between termination of therapy and the initiation of employment”, issued a letter of reprimand and imposed administrative penalties. The board also investigated claims made by the patient of inappropriate contact initiated by McGraw, but the “Findings of Fact” document issued by the board on October 21, 1988, at the end of its investigation includes no reference to any physical contact of any kind. It specifically identified “the therapeutic and business relationships” as constituting McGraw’s sole issue with the board. McGraw fulfilled all terms of the board’s requirements, and the board closed its complaint file in June 1990.</p><p align=justify>McGraw married his first wife, an ex-cheerleader and homecoming queen named Debbie Higgins McCall, in 1970, when he was 20 years old. According to her, McGraw was domineering and would not allow her to participate in the family business. She claimed that she was confined to domestic duties and instructed to begin lifting weights to improve her bustline.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Phil McGraw</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Phil</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>McGraw</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>College Student Personnel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 1</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vinita</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vinita</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Phil McGraw ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
