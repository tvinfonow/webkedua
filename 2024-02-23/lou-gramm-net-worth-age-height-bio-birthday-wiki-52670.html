Gramm wanted the band to remain true to its purer rock origins, favoring music with a solid drum and guitar structure, whereas Jones embraced the 1980s style of synthesizer ballads. Gramm has called the 4 album (1981) the high point of his work with Foreigner. Foreigner’s next album, Agent Provocateur (1984), took three years to release due to the ongoing creative differences between Jones and Gramm. The band released Inside Information in 1987.</p><p>Foreigner’s first eight singles cracked the Billboard Top 20, making them the first band since The Beatles to achieve this milestone. Gramm performed vocals on all of Foreigner’s hits including “Urgent”, “Juke Box Hero”, “Break It Up”, “Say You Will”, and “I Don’t Want to Live Without You”. He co-wrote most of the band’s songs, including the hit ballads “Waiting for a Girl Like You”, which spent ten weeks at #2 on the 1981/82 American Hot 100, and “I Want to Know What Love Is”, which was a number one hit in eight countries.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Lou Gramm height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Lou <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Gramm became front man for the band Black Sheep.
