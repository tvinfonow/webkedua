The publication noted that while there appeared be no obvious, “smoking gun” violations in the video, it was possible that investigators would later discover something in the footage. However, it was also reported that the earlier, nine-minute video titled “Horse Racing Exposed: Drugs and Death” that PETA released on its web site had been heavily edited. Blood-Horse noted in particular that PETA had moved audio segments, especially of Blasi’s outbursts of profanity, to run with completely unrelated video clips.</p><p>On 2014 Kentucky Derby weekend in early May, Asmussen responded to charges in an interview with Bob Costas of NBC. In the interview he denied all accusations, noted that nothing in the PETA video alleged a rule violation or illegal medication use, and stated that assistant Scott Blasi had been fired due to his “disrespectful” comments about Ahmed Zayat. Asmussen said, “Hopefully I do get a chance [to go to court] – and not just to defend myself.” In response to a follow up query from Costas, he acknowledged that it would be possible that he would consider some form of counter-action against PETA. Blasi was rehired by Asmussen several months later.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Steve Asmussen height</b> Not available right now.
