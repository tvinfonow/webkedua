The fight was set for April 9, 2016 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. It was reported that Pacquiao would earn $20 million and Bradley would earn $4 million from the fight.

ESPN.com scored it for 117-109 also in favor of Pacquiao. Bradley was down once in round seven and again in round nine. In the post fight Bradley spoke about how patience was the key difference in the fight, “Manny was very strong in there. Very heavy punches. He was also very patient. I wasn’t professional enough to stay patient myself, and I walked into shots.” CompuBox statistics showed that Pacquiao landed 122 of 439 punches (28%), whereas Bradley connected on 99 of his 302 punches thrown (33%).
