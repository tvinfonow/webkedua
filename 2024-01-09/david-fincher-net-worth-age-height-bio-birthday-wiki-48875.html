His work has received multiple nominations in the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. Born in Denver, Colorado, Fincher developed a passion for filmmaking at an early age. He first gained recognition from directing numerous music videos. He then made his directorial debut with the feature film Alien 3 (1992), which garnered mixed reviews, followed by the thriller Seven (1995), which was better received. Fincher found lukewarm success with The Game (1997) and Fight Club (1999), with the latter eventually becoming a cult classic. In 2002, he returned with a critical and box office success, Panic Room (2002).</p><p>Fight Club was scored by The Dust Brothers, who at that point had never scored for a film. Describing their working relationship with Fincher, they said he “was not hanging over our shoulders telling us what to do”; the only direction he gave was to make the music sound as great as the score from The Graduate (1967). Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the music for The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Gone Girl. The musicians describe their working relationship as “collaborative, respectful and inspiring” although it “hasn’t gotten any easier”. Howard Shore composed the scores for three films; Seven, The Game and Panic Room.</p><p align=justify>He had a child through his union with Donya Fiorentino.&nbsp;His relationship has been a long-term affair to Cean Chaffin since the year 1996.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>David Fincher</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>David</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fincher</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Director</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Denver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Colorado</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ceán Chaffin , Donya Fiorentino</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>David Fincher ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It was the third installment in the Alien franchise starring Sigourney Weaver. The film was released in May 1992 to a mixed reception from critics and was considered weaker than the preceding films. From the beginning, Alien 3 was hampered by studio intervention and several abandoned scripts. Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone calls the film, “bold and haunting”, despite the “struggle of nine writers” and “studio interference”. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. Years later, Fincher publicly expressed his dismay and subsequently disowned the film. In the book Director’s Cut: Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century, Fincher blames the producers for their lack of trust in him. In an interview with The Guardian in 2009, he stated, “No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>David Fincher height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> David <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While establishing himself in the film industry, Fincher was employed at John Korty’s studio as a production head. Gaining further experience, he became a visual effects producer, working on the animated Twice Upon a Time (1983) with George Lucas. He was hired by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) in 1983 as an assistant cameraman and matte photographer and worked on Return of the Jedi (1983) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). In 1984, he left ILM to direct a television commercial for the American Cancer Society that depicted a fetus smoking a cigarette. This quickly brought Fincher to the attention of producers in Los Angeles, and he was soon given the opportunity to direct Rick Springfield’s 1985 documentary, The Beat of the Live Drum. Set on a directing career, Fincher co-founded production company Propaganda Films and started directing commercials and music videos. Other directors such as Michael Bay, Antoine Fuqua, Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, Alex Proyas, Paul Rachman, Mark Romanek, Zack Snyder and Gore Verbinski also honed their skills at Propaganda Films before moving on to feature films.</p><p align=justify>Darius Khondji and Jeff Cronenweth have served as cinematographers for Fincher’s films. Khondji said, “Fincher deserves a lot of credit. It was his influence that pushed me to experiment and got me as far as I did”. The director has hired sound designer Ren Kylce in all his films since 1995, whom Fincher trusts “implicitly”. Fincher has also worked with film editor Angus Wall since 1988, who has edited six of his films. Donald Graham Burt has served as a production designer for five films and Bob Wagner has served as an assistant director for six. Lastly, casting director Laray Mayfield has worked with Fincher for more than thirty years. In a 2010 interview, Fincher said, “you don’t have to love all of your co-collaborators, but you do have to respect them. And when you do, when you realize that people bring stuff to the table that’s not necessarily your experience, but if you allow yourself to relate to it, it can enrich the buffet that you’re going to bring with you into the editing room.”</p><h2>Who is David Fincher Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>David Fincher</strong> married to <strong>Ceán Chaffin , Donya Fiorentino </strong>.

He briefly retreated back to directing commercials and music videos, including the video for the song “Love Is Strong” by The Rolling Stones in 1994, which won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video. Shortly, Fincher decided to make a foray back into film. He read Andrew Kevin Walker’s original screenplay for Seven (1995), which had been revised by Jeremiah Chechik, the director attached to the project at one point. Fincher expressed no interest in directing the revised version, so New Line Cinema agreed to keep the original ending. Starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Kevin Spacey, it tells the story of two detectives who attempt to identify a serial killer who bases his murders on the Christian seven deadly sins. Seven was positively received by film critics was one of the highest-earning films of 1995, grossing more than $320&nbsp;million worldwide. Writing for Sight and Sound, John Wrathall said it “stands as the most complex and disturbing entry in the serial killer genre since Manhunter” and Roger Ebert opined that Seven is “one of the darkest and most merciless films ever made in the Hollywood mainstream.”</p><h2>Top Facts about David Fincher</h2><li>David Fincher was born on August 28, 1962 in Denver, Colorado.</li><li>He has directed critically acclaimed films such as Fight Club and The Social Network.</li><li>Fincher has been nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Director.</li><li>He started his career directing music videos for artists like Madonna and Michael Jackson.</li><li>Fincher’s father worked as a reporter and he often accompanied him to crime scenes, which influenced his interest in dark subject matter.</li><li>He is known for his meticulous attention to detail and use of visual effects.</li><li>Fincher has also directed episodes of popular TV shows like House of Cards and Mindhunter.</li><li>His film Zodiac is based on the real-life unsolved case of the Zodiac Killer in San Francisco during the late 1960s and early 1970s.</li><li>Fincher’s films have grossed over $2 billion worldwide at the box office.</li><li>He is married to producer Ceán Chaffin, who has produced many of his films including The Social Network and Gone Girl.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>David Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Director</strong>.

David Fincher celebrates birthday on August 28 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Following Seven, Fincher directed a music video for “6th Avenue Heartache” by The Wallflowers and went on to direct his third feature film, the mystery thriller The Game (1997), written by the duo John Brancato and Michael Ferris. Fincher also hired Seven screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker to contribute and polish the script. Filmed on location in San Francisco, the story follows an investment banker, played by Michael Douglas, who receives an unusual gift from his younger brother (Sean Penn), where he becomes involved in a “game” that integrates with his everyday life, making him unable to differentiate between game and reality. Almar Haflidason of the BBC was critical of the ending, but praised the visuals—”Fincher does a marvelous job of turning ordinary city locations into frightening backdrops, where every corner turned is another step into the unknown”. Upon The Game’s release in September 1997, the film received generally favorable reviews but performed moderately at the box office. Sometime afterwards, The Game garnered enough reappraisal to be included as part of the Criterion Collection.</p><h3>What is David Fincher's best movie?</h3><ul><li>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) Trailer. …</li><li>Mank (2020) Trailer. …</li><li>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) Trailer. 71 % …</li><li>The Social Network (2010) Trailer. 95 % …</li><li>Fight Club (1999) Trailer. 66 % …</li><li>Gone Girl (2014) 79 % 8.1/10. …</li><li>Zodiac (2007) Trailer. 78 % …</li><li>Se7en (1995) Trailer. 65 %</li></ul><h3>Who is David Fincher's wife?</h3><p>Wife</p><h3>Is David Fincher making a new movie?</h3><p><b>David Fincher’s “The Killer” is one of next year’s most anticipated films for fans of the director</b> — and the movie’s trifecta on offer: Fincher directs Michael Fassbender as a contract killer, with “Seven” screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker returning, and cinematography from Erik Messerschmidt, the Oscar-winning DP of …</p><h3>What is David Fincher known for?</h3><p>David Fincher, in full David Leo Fincher, (born August 28, 1962, Denver, Colorado, U.S.), American music video and film director known for <b>his stylish movies</b>, which usually trended toward the dark and atmospheric.</p><h3>How accurate was the social network?</h3><p><b>The movie isn’t terribly accurate</b> (and Sorkin won’t argue) Given that “The Social Network” isn’t just based on a true story but on a relatively recent true story, it’s not surprising that a lot of people were combing through the film to assess the accuracy.</p>You may read full biography about David Fincher from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfma63tcNmnaKmk52ys3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=/2024-01-09/david-ryall-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48893.html>&#171;&nbsp;David Ryall Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a>
