Robinson’s next Hot 100 appearance was in August 1977, with her version of David Gates’ “Hold Tight”, which peaked at #67 (and #2 on the disco chart). Its parent album, Half and Half, again produced by Schatz, was not released until 1978 and peaked at #110. In 1979, Robinson contributed the track “Easy to Be Hard” to the Schatz production Disco Spectacular – an album of dance versions of songs from the musical Hair inspired by the release of film version – and recorded what would prove to be her final album, Movin’ On. Although Schatz was credited as the album’s executive producer, that job was done by Evelyn King’s producer, T. Life. Movin’ On’s tracks were ignored in the dance clubs, but Robinson scored a 1979 club hit with “Nighttime Fantasy,” a track written and produced by Norman Bergen and Reid Whitelaw recorded for the film Nocturna: Granddaughter of Dracula. Also in 1979, Robinson appeared in a film made by the same production company as Nocturna: Granddaughter of Dracula titled Gangsters (now called Hoodlums), which also featured T.

Warren Schatz, a producer/engineer with RCA Records, was struck by Robinson’s voice and saw her potential as a disco-oriented artist. Schatz invited Robinson to cut some demos including a remake of the Foundations’ “Baby Now That I’ve Found You” which became Robinson’s first solo release. Despite that track’s failure, RCA green-lit Schatz’s producing Robinson’s debut album Never Gonna Let You Go. The title cut, a Schatz original, became a #10 disco hit but another album track, “Turn the Beat Around,” began to build “buzz” and was expediently released as a single, topping the disco charts on March 20, 1976. “Turn the Beat Around” broke on Top 40 radio in Boston in May, almost immediately topping the charts there. Despite failure to crack the major market of Los Angeles, “Turn the Beat Around” reached the U.S. Top 10 in August, spending around six months overall on the Billboard Hot 100 and propelling the Never Gonna Let You Go album to #49. “Turn the Beat Around” would chart internationally, reaching #14 in Canada, #44 in France, #11 in the Netherlands and #12 in South Africa.
