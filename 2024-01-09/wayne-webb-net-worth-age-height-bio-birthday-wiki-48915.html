He was named PBA Player of the Year in 1980, the only player not named Earl Anthony or Mark Roth to win that award in an 11-season stretch (1974-1984). He became a member of the PBA Hall of Fame in 1993. His 20th and final PBA Tour title came in 1997 at the Bud Light Championship. The 20 titles puts Webb in a 13th-place tie with fellow PBA Hall of Famers Dick Ritger, Amleto Monacelli and Tommy Jones. A panel of bowling experts selected by the PBA ranked Webb #18 on their 2008 list of “50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years.”</p><p>The son of a bowling center operator, Webb knew from age twelve that “all I ever wanted to be was a professional bowler.” He was eighteen when he got his wish and joined the PBA (Professional Bowlers Association) tour in 1975. He found success quickly, winning his first tournament at age 21 and earning “Player of the Year” honors by age 23. On November 2, 1982, Webb won the Columbia 300 Open in Sterling Heights, Michigan to become the youngest player in PBA history (25 years, 90 days) to reach ten career PBA titles. That feat would be bested by just one day when Mike Aulby won his tenth title in 1985 at age 25 years, 89 days. Webb remains the third-youngest player to reach ten titles as of 2019, behind Pete Weber (24 years, 247 days) and Aulby.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wayne Webb</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Abdullah</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Al-Rashidi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bowler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Wayne Webb ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
