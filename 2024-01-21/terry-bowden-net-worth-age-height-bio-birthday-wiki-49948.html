Terry Wilson Bowden (born February 24 1956) is a college football coach currently working as an assistant coach at Clemson University.&nbsp;Bowden was the head coaching for Salem University (1983-1985), Samford University (1987-1992), Auburn University (1993-1998), the University of North Alabama (2009-2011) as well as in the University of Akron (2012-2018).&nbsp;Bowden is the father of the former Florida State University head football coach Bobby Bowden and a brother of Tommy Bowden, former head football coach at Clemson University and Jeff Bowden, the former offensive coordinator at Florida State who served as Terry’s special teams coordinator at Akron.</p><p>His first year as a coach at Auburn during 1993 Bowden took his Tigers to a flawless 11-0 record as an early coach who managed to win without losing during his first year at a Division 1 school.&nbsp;in 1994, Auburn ended the year 9-1-1 setting the record for one of the most successful winning streaks in the history of the school of 20 games.</p><p>After resigning at Auburn, Bowden accepted a role as a studio analyst and color commentator for ABC Sports’ college football coverage where he often referred to his father Bobby Bowden as “Daddy.” He was also an exclusive college football columnist for Yahoo! Sports. For a period, Bowden also hosted a sports talk radio show in the Orlando, Florida area. In 2006, Bowden became the expert analyst for Westwood One radio network’s College Football National Game of Week. He also co-hosted “The Coaches Show” on Sirius Satellite Radio with Jack Arute and worked several times a month as a motivational speaker.</p><p>In a July 30, 2007 column, writing a few weeks before the 2007 college football season, Bowden said he was eager to go back to coaching for the 2008 football season. In December 2007, the coaching job at his alma mater West Virginia opened up: Rich Rodriguez left to be Michigan’s coach. Bowden issued a statement which read in part, “Coming home to West Virginia would obviously be the dream job for me.” However, West Virginia offered the job to one of Rodriguez’s assistants, Bill Stewart, who was the interim head coach when the Mountaineers upset the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2008 Fiesta Bowl. In late 2007, Bowden interviewed for the head coaching job at Georgia Tech, which ultimately went to Paul Johnson.</p><p align=justify>in 1992 Bowden became the successor to Pat Dye as the head football coach at Auburn University.&nbsp;Bowden’s appointment came as the team was under NCAA sanctions that included the reduction of scholarships, a one year television ban, as well as the suspension of two years for postseason play.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=8><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Terry Bowden</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Terry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bowden</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Douglas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Georgia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bobby Bowden, Julia Ann Estock</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tommy Bowden, Jeff Bowden, Steve Bowden, Robyn Hines, Ginger Madden</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=7><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Terry Bowden Jr., Jordan Bowden, Cori Bowden, Tera Bowden, Erin Bowden, Jamie Bowden</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Terry Bowden ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

These issues, combined with a string of player injuries, led to a disastrous start of the 1998 season. After starting with a 1–5 record, Bowden resigned as head coach the night before Auburn played against Louisiana Tech. In conversations with athletic director David Housel, Bowden was given no assurances he would have a chance to remedy the situation for the next season, and that he believed his termination was imminent.
