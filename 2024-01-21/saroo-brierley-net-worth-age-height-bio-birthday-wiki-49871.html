As an adult, he spent many hours over many months conducting searches using the satellite images on Google Earth, painstakingly following railway lines radiating out from Howrah railway station. He relied on his vague memories of the main features around Burhanpur railway station, although he knew little of the name of the station except that it began with the letter B. Late one night in 2011, he came upon a small railway station that closely matched his childhood recollection of where he had become trapped in an empty carriage; the name of this station was Burhanpur, very close to a phonetic spelling of the name he remembered from his childhood ordeal. He followed the satellite images of the railway line north and found the town of Khandwa. He had no recollection of that name, but the town contained recognizable features, such as a fountain near the train tracks where he used to play. He was able to trace a path through the streets to what appeared to be the place where he and his family used to live.</p><p>In 2012, Saroo travelled to Khandwa in India and asked residents if they knew of any family that had lost their son 25 years ago. He showed photographs of himself as a child in Hobart. Local people soon led him to his mother. He was also reunited with his sister, Shekila, and his surviving brother, Kallu, who were now a schoolteacher and factory manager, respectively. With Saroo and Guddu gone, their mother had been able to afford to send the other two to school. The reunion was extensively covered by Indian and international media.</p><p align=justify>His birth mother is Fatima Munshi, and his adopted parents are Sue and John Brierley.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Saroo Brierley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Saroo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brierley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Business Executive</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Khandwa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Madhya Pradesh</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>India</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sue Brierley, John Brierley, Fatima Munshi</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Saroo Brierley ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
