The hit forced Draper face-first into the dasher (the top edge of the boards), causing him to suffer a broken jaw, broken nose, broken cheekbone and a concussion. After the game, when interviewed about the hit and the handshake line, Draper’s teammate, Dino Ciccarelli, reacted and coldly remarked, “I can’t believe I shook this guy’s friggin’ hand after the game! That pisses me right off!” When the Wings and Avalanche met again on March 26, 1997, play was very physical between the two teams, and the existing animosity over the hit on Draper set off a massive brawl (“Brawl in Hockeytown”) between the two teams.</p><h2>Chris Draper Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Chris Draper is one of the <strong>richest Ice Hockey Player</strong> from Canada.

He is a rarity in that he played in the American Hockey League (AHL) and NHL before playing junior in the OHL. After playing just 20 NHL games for the Jets in four seasons since he was drafted, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in 1993 in exchange for $1. Doug MacLean, the general manager of the Adirondack Red Wings at the time and a former Detroit Red Wings assistant, was responsible for the trade. Draper would quickly become a valuable fixture for Detroit, and he began his reputation as the “One Dollar Man,” eventually becoming one of only seven players (four others were longtime teammates) to play over 1,000 games in a Red Wings uniform.</p><p align=justify>On March 17, 2009, Draper became the fifth player to play 1,000 games in a Red Wing uniform, a feat accomplished only by Gordie Howe, Alex Delvecchio, Steve Yzerman, Nicklas Lidström and Tomas Holmström. All aforementioned players, save for Holmström, are enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and all have had their numbers retired by the Red Wings, except for Holmström. In Draper’s case, his 1,000th game in a Red Wing uniform was his 1,020th game overall (passing the 1,000 NHL game milestone February 2, 2009).</p><h2>Who is Chris Draper Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Chris Draper</strong> married to <strong>Julie Draper</strong>.
