Piotr Rubik, a Polish composer of symphonic Pop music for orchestra, film and theatre was born 3 September 1968 in Warsaw.</p><p>Tu Es Petrus was composed in 2005 to be a birthday gift for Pope John Paul II. However, the Pope died before it was completed.&nbsp;Rubik called it later an “epitaph”, referring to John Paul II.&nbsp;“Tu Es Petrus,” Latin for “You Are Peter”, is a reference to Matthew 16.18. This statement, which Catholics believe made Peter the head of the Church (and, by extension, Peter’s successors), by the authority Jesus Christ.</p><p>In the summer of 2007, Rubik again teamed with Zbigniew Książek to write and conduct an orchestral and choral cantata for the 750th anniversary of Cracow’s township, called Zakochani w Krakowie (roughly translated “In love, in Cracow”). It proved to be wildly popular among Cracovians, with multiple encores played at the sole performance that took place in Cracow’s town square on June 1, 2007.</p><p>Rubik has also performed North America numerous times since September 2007. In October–November 2010, the composer and conductor went on a tour of 17 concerts in the US and Canada, starting in Trenton, New Jersey, and finishing the tour in Chicago, Illinois.</p><p align=justify>Tu Es Petrus was premiered July 2, 2005 to great critical and public success.&nbsp;After the success of Oratorium Swietokrzyska Golgota the previous year, and the intense interest in Pope John Paul II’s legacy and life, Rubik’s new opera was immediately called his greatest opus.&nbsp;To great acclaim, the oratorio would be performed in many cities in Poland and in the United States in the years to come.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Piotr Rubik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Piotr</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rubik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Composer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Warsaw</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Masovian Voivodeship</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Poland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Żanetta Wrońska</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Agata Paskudzka</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Helena Rubik, Alicja Rubik</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Piotr Rubik ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Piotr Rubik</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Oratorium Psalterz Wrzesniowy (“The September Psalter”) draws its inspiration from The Book of Psalms, and examines their relevance for us today.&nbsp;The “Septembers” are September 11, 2001, and September 1,1939, when the Nazis invaded Poland. This device refers to the forces and evil wherever and whenever they strike.&nbsp;Oratorium Psalterz Wrzesniowy was opened in Kielce on September 11, 2006.&nbsp;Rubik visited this oratorio in Poland and North America, just like Tu Es Petrus.</p><p align=justify>Swietokrzyska Golgota was premiered at the Cathedral Basilica, Kielce, Poland on April 6, 2004.</p><p align=justify>Following the success of Zakochani w Krakowie, Rubik wrote a new oratorio, with the incomprehensibly long title of Oratorium dla Świata, część I: Habitat, moje miejsce na ziemi (“Oratorio for the World, part I: Habitat, my place on earth”). Featuring six new, younger soloists, Habitat opened in December 2007 with a decisive new twist: the addition of a DJ and beatboxers to Rubik’s traditional hundred-member orchestra and hundred and twenty-strong choir. Habitat proved to be much more pop than classical (although Rubik had always blurred these lines) with the addition of several innovations, such as the piece “Most Dwojga Serc” (Bridge between hearts), which featured the composer and conductor himself playing the piano and singing. Other notable features include the Gospel-esque chorus of “Serce Dzwonu”, translated as “Heart of the bell” (with its ringing refrain of “Gloria, Gloria”); the operatic “Katedra” (Cathedral); the children’s song “Schody donikąd” (Staircase to nowhere); and the beatboxing featured in the epilogue piece “Habitat”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Composer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>November 8, 2011 was when Rubik released Opisanie Świata. The project once again united him with Zbigniew Ksiązek, who wrote the lyrics. Opisanie Świata was, to a degree, similar to “Habitat”, in which love was a central theme. This work also was described as a rock opera by Piotr Rubik, as it included drums and guitars, unlike any of his other compositions.</p><p>Some music critics in Poland have suggested that Rubik’s work is amateurish and banal, especially after the completion of Zakochani w Krakowie. Stanisław Krawczyński, head of the Academy of Music in Cracow, called it a “scandal” that his Academy had been passed over in favor of Rubik to open the 750th anniversary celebrations. At the same time, fellow composer Krystyna Moszumańska-Nazar called him an “amateur,” and Cracovian filmmaker Artur Więcek rhetorically asked why his (taxpayer) money should be spent on Rubik’s “pseudoreligious” work for the festival.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Piotr Rubik height</b> Not available right now.

Libretto for this work was written by Jacek Cygan. The story starts with the song “Lolek”, beginning with Wojtyła’s early life in Wadowice. It continues with songs mentioning Karol Wojtyla’s love of theater, his priesthood, and papacy. In many of the pieces in Santo Subito, the text contains various facts and interesting information regarding culture and the pope’s life.</p><p align=justify>Despite the titular subject matter, Oratorium Psałterz Wrześniowy remains a commentary on the triumph of the human spirit over the tyranny of evil. It delves deep into Christian tradition in its texts. The oratorio is divided into four parts — Psalms of Faith, with songs referring to the Apostles’ Creed, Adam and Eve, Abraham, and Moses; Psalms of the Angels, which speak of the heavenly protectors; Psalms of Hope, which range from themes of repentance to the defeat of despair; and Psalms of Love, a series of love songs, including the popular hit song “Psalm dla Ciebie” (Psalm for You).</p><h2>Who is Piotr Rubik Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Piotr Rubik</strong> married to <strong>Agata Paskudzka </strong>.
