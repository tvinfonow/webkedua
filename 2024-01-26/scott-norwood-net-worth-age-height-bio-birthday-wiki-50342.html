The kicker of The Buffalo Bills from 1985-1991 who was famously criticized for missing a 47-yard field goal that could have won the Super Bowl.</p><p>He was a professional for many years with legend&nbsp;He spent his career playing alongside legend <a href=#>Jim Kelly</a>..</p><p>Norwood was born in Alexandria, Virginia and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria in 1978. He played both football and soccer at James Madison University and graduated with a business degree in 1982.</p><p>Norwood was one of many players the Bills picked up as the USFL contracted and ultimately collapsed; he eventually beat out Todd Schlopy (who would later come back when Norwood went on strike in 1987) for the Bills’ starting kicker position. He quickly became an asset to an offense that was going places as the Bills’ general manager, Bill Polian, assembled talent like Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, and, on defense Bruce Smith. Within two seasons of Norwood’s arrival, the Bills had won the AFC East for the first time since 1980 and made it to the conference championship game. He soon overtook O.J. Simpson as the team’s all-time leading scorer. Following the 1990 season, the Bills advanced to their first-ever Super Bowl.</p><p align=justify>He was married during his professional career, and has three kids.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scott Norwood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scott</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Norwood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alexandria</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virginia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Del</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sandra, Steve</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kim Burch</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Carly, Connor, Corey</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Scott Norwood ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The Bills returned to the Super Bowl and Norwood was perfect throughout the postseason, including a 44-yard field goal that served as the decisive margin in the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos.</p><h2>Scott Norwood Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Scott Norwood is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Scott Norwood</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He played soccer and football in the NCAA soccer tournament at James Madison University, and was a part of the USFL before joining the Bills.</p><p align=justify>In 1988, he was an All Pro selection in 1988. Pro Bowl and All Pro selection.</p><p align=justify>Scott Allan Norwood (born July 17, 1960) is a former American football placekicker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for seven seasons and spent the entirety of his career with the Buffalo Bills. He also played for the Birmingham Stallions in the United States Football League (USFL). An integral part of Buffalo’s offense during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Norwood kicked in the team’s first two Super Bowl appearances. Despite his accomplishments, he is best known for missing a game-winning field goal attempt at the end of Super Bowl XXV.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Norwood’s field goal range was unusually short for a professional kicker and he had difficulties in converting field goals over 40 yards throughout his career, especially on natural grass (the Bills’ home stadium used AstroTurf, which mitigated this issue). Super Bowl XXV, which was played on January 27, 1991, cemented Norwood’s name in football history when he missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 8 seconds left in the game, giving the New York Giants their 2nd Super Bowl victory, and started the Bills’ string of four consecutive Super Bowl losses. This kick was made famous by the “wide right” call by the TV announcers.</p><p>In the 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, a key plot point involves a kicker for the Miami Dolphins named Ray Finkle; in the story, Finkle misses a field goal attempt in the closing moments of Super Bowl XVII, causing the Dolphins to lose the game by a single point – an obvious reference to Norwood’s infamous kick in Super Bowl XXV. (In reality, Super Bowl XVII was contested between the Dolphins and the Washington Redskins; the Redskins won 27-17.)</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Scott Norwood height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Scott <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After the Bills waived him, Norwood initially returned home to Northern Virginia and disappeared completely from the public eye for a number of years, eventually becoming an insurance salesman through the 1990s before returning to Buffalo as a real estate agent in 2002.</p><p align=justify>The 1998 film Buffalo ’66 features a subplot where main character Billy Brown, played by Vincent Gallo, attempts to murder a former Buffalo kicker named “Scott Wood”, whose missed field goal led to Brown losing a large bet and serving a prison term when he took the fall for his bookie.</p><h2>Who is Scott Norwood Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Scott Norwood</strong> married to <strong>Kim Burch </strong>.
