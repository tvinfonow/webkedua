She was also an eleventh great-granddaughter of Mayflower passengers Francis Cooke and Richard Warren, both through her maternal grandfather Harrison Marshall Robertson. Carpenter lived in Japan from 1969 to 1971 before moving to Washington, D.C. She attended Princeton Day School, a private coeducational prep school, before graduating from The Taft School in 1976.</p><p>The sixth single on Come On Come On, “He Thinks He’ll Keep Her”, was Carpenter’s biggest hit off the album, charting at No.&nbsp;2 on Billboard’s Country chart and at No.&nbsp;1 on Radio & Records’s Country chart. Written by Carpenter and Don Schlitz, the fast-paced song follows a 36-year-old homemaker who leaves her husband, and was inspired by a 1970s series of Geritol commercials in which a man boasts of his wife’s seemingly limitless energy and her many accomplishments, then concludes by saying, “My wife … I think I’ll keep her.” Carpenter said, “That line has always stuck with me. It’s just such a joke.” The single received a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year.</p><p align=justify>The divorce of her parents occurred when she reached 16 years old.&nbsp;She later got married Timmy Smith.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mary Chapin Carpenter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mary</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carpenter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Princeton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Chapin Carpenter Jr.</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mary Bowie Robertson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mary Chapin Carpenter ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Though songs from Hometown Girl got play on public and college radio stations, it was not until Columbia began promoting Carpenter as a “country” artist that she found a wider audience. For a long time, Carpenter was ambivalent about this pigeonholing, saying she preferred the term “singer-songwriter” or “slash rocker” (as in country/folk/rock). She told Rolling Stone in 1991, “I’ve never approached music from a categorization process, so to be a casualty of it is real disconcerting to me”.</p><h2>Mary Chapin Carpenter Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mary Chapin Carpenter is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.

Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter’s first album, 1987’s Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989’s State of the Heart and 1990’s Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The songs of Come On Come On had the qualities that would come to identify her work: humorous, fast-paced country-rock songs with themes of perseverance, desire, and independence, alternating with slow, introspective ballads that speak to social or relational issues. “Passionate Kisses”, a cover of fellow singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams’s 1988 song, was the album’s third single. Carpenter’s version peaked on the U.S. Country chart at No.&nbsp;4, and was the first of Carpenter’s songs to cross over to mainstream pop and adult contemporary charts, charting at No.&nbsp;57 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No.&nbsp;11 on Adult Contemporary.</p><p>After 1989’s State of the Heart, Carpenter released Shooting Straight in the Dark in 1990, which yielded her biggest single up to that point, the Grammy Award-winning “Down at the Twist and Shout”. Two years later, Carpenter released the album that, to date, has been her biggest popular success, Come On Come On (1992). The album went quadruple platinum, remaining on the Country Top 100 list for more than 97 weeks, and eventually spawned seven charting singles. Come On Come On was also critically acclaimed; The New York Times’s Karen Schoemer wrote that Carpenter had “risen through the country ranks without flash or bravado: no big hair, sequined gowns, teary performances…. Enriched with Ms. Carpenter’s subtlety, Come On Come On grows stronger and prettier with every listen.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mary Chapin Carpenter height</b> Not available right now.

Carpenter played some summer sets in Washington’s music scene, where she met guitarist John Jennings, who would become her producer and long-time collaborator. However, she considered music a hobby and planned on getting a “real job”. She briefly quit performing, but after several job interviews decided to return to music. Carpenter was persuaded by Jennings to play original material instead of covers. Within a few years, she landed a manager and recorded a demo tape that led to a deal with Columbia Records.</p><p align=justify>Carpenter’s most successful album to date remains 1992’s Come On Come On, which yielded seven charting country singles and was certified quadruple platinum in the US for sales exceeding four million copies. She followed it with Stones in the Road (1994) and A Place in the World (1996), which both featured hit singles. In the 2000s, Carpenter’s albums departed both thematically and musically from her early work, becoming less radio-friendly and more focused on societal and political issues. In 2007, she released The Calling. She followed that with The Age of Miracles (2010), Ashes and Roses (2012) and the orchestral album, Songs From the Movie (2014).</p><h2>Who is Mary Chapin Carpenter Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mary Chapin Carpenter</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
