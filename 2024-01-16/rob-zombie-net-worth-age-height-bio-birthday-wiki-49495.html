He is a founding member of the heavy metal band White Zombie, releasing four studio albums with the band. He is the older brother of Spider One, the lead vocalist of the industrial metal band Powerman 5000.</p><p>Both Zombie’s music and film work draws influence from classic horror and suspense films, with Zombie citing the 1970s as the “last great time where films were being made for the sake of the film and not for the sake of the money.” Zombie has cited artists such as Alice Cooper, Kiss, Queen, and Elton John as influences during his childhood. Zombie claimed that the first record he ever bought was an Alice Cooper album. Metallica, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Slayer, Ministry, Pantera, Sepultura, Black Flag and Twisted Sister were also cited as influences by Zombie. Zombie claimed his mother would not allow him to watch horror films, namely The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), which later served as an influence on Zombie’s films House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil’s Rejects. Zombie has directed the majority of his music videos as a solo artist, with numerous releases being influenced or referencing horror films. The music video for his single “Living Dead Girl” is based upon the silent horror film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), while his video for “Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)” was heavily inspired by A Clockwork Orange (1971). His film The Lords of Salem was inspired by the horror classic The Shining (1980).</p><p align=justify>On October 31, 2002, he married&nbsp;Sheri Zombie&nbsp;and she is often seen in his films.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rob Zombie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rob</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Zombie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Metal Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Haverhill</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Louise Cummings, Robert Cummings</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sheri Moon Zombie</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rob Zombie ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

I remember this one guy we knew, he was telling us where to go, and some guy just ran up to him and hit him in the face with a hammer – just busted his face wide open. My parents packed up real quick, and we took off.” Cummings graduated from Haverhill High School in 1983.

The album went on to sell over one million copies in the United States, his second to accomplish this feat. The album was preceded by the single “Feel So Numb”, with a second single being released the following year. Despite the album’s success, it was noted as a decline in sales when compared to his first studio album. The Sinister Urge and its subsequent singles were met with a positive critical reception, with AllMusic writing “It is the slow burn of [the album’s] last track that shows the most promise; after years of making good heavy metal, he finally expands the boundaries of his own sound. Few metal musicians kept their sound fresh for as long as Zombie, and this album is no exception.” The Sinister Urge was voted as the fans’ favorite album on Zombie’s official website. The album is the final project to feature guitarist Mike Riggs and drummer John Tempesta, who had been with Zombie since the start of his solo career.</p><h3>What is Rob Zombie's most famous song?</h3><p><b>‘Dragula’</b> “Dragula” tops our list of the 10 best Rob Zombie songs.
