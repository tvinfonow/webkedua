She recorded her solo debut album, Ridiculous, so-named for the many different musical styles on the album. The album spawned two buzz singles (“Let Him Go” and “Just Cuz”) in hopes of garnering attention from the public eye; however, when the songs failed to gain impact on urban radio outlets, the album was pushed back and canceled. That same year, Tamar was featured on Sole’s, “4 The Love of You.” Instead of shelving the album, Dreamworks Records abandoned 3 old tracks, added new ones, and renamed it Tamar.
