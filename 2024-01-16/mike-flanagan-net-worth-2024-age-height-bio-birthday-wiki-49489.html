Who is Mike Flanagan dating now & how much money does Mike Flanagan have?</p><h2>Mike Flanagan Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Mike Flanagan</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Film Director</strong> who was born on <strong>May 20, 1978</strong> in Salem, Salem, <strong>United States</strong>. Flanagan was born in 1978 in Salem, Massachusetts. His father was in the United States Coast Guard, and the family moved around often. Although he only briefly lived in Salem, it left an impression on him, and Flanagan retained an abiding interest in both the Salem witch trials and associated topics, such as ghost stories and horror fiction. He was a student at Archbishop Spalding High School. Flanagan eventually ended up in Maryland, where he attended Towson University. He graduated with a BA in Electronic Media & Film and a minor in Theater.</p><p>Made for $70,000, and filmed in his Glendale, California, apartment, Absentia was released direct-to-video but gained popularity when Netflix offered it on their streaming service. After the surprise success of Absentia, Flanagan returned to Oculus, which he again shopped around. Intrepid Pictures took an interest in the concept and agreed to let Flanagan direct. The feature version of Oculus was filmed in 2012 and released theatrically by Relativity Media in 2014.</p><p>After Oculus, Flanagan shot his next film, Before I Wake, in 2013. The film was acquired by Relativity Media in 2014, and was originally scheduled to be released on May 8, 2015, but was pushed back to September 25, 2015 and later pulled from the schedule due to the company’s filing for bankruptcy. After a year in bankruptcy court, Relativity then announced the film would be released on April 8, 2016, but did not release the film on the promised date, as the company struggled to get back on its feet. The film was then scheduled to be released on September 9, 2016, but three weeks prior to that date, Relativity once again pulled the film from the schedule, prompting a public argument between Flanagan and Relativity CEO Ryan Kavanaugh on Twitter. Kavanaugh claimed the Sept 9 date was a “bad date,” while Flanagan suggested that Relativity wasn’t financially able to release the film. Relativity never did release the film, as Kavanaugh sold Relativity to Singapore-based social networking platform YuuZoo in October 2016. Netflix eventually acquired the rights and released the film in January 2018.</p><p>Flanagan was formerly in a relationship with Absentia actress Courtney Bell, with whom he has a son. Since February 2016, he has been married to actress Kate Siegel, with whom he has two children, one son and one daughter.</p><p align=justify>Flanagan originally intended for the Oculus story to be told in a series of short films, but he could not find the financing. Instead, he shot the chapter that included a back story and used that to demonstrate that he could direct a horror film. The short proved popular at film festivals, and producers were interested in developing the concept; however, they either wanted to shoot it as a found footage film or rejected Flanagan’s stipulation that he direct the feature-length adaptation. Flanagan directed Absentia (2011), which was financed through a Kickstarter campaign, in response to this rejection.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike Flanagan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Flanagan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Film Director</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1978</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Salem</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Salem</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Timothy Flanagan, Laura Flanagan</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kate Siegel , Shea Cerveny</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Theodora Isabelle Irene Flanagan, Cody Paul Flanagan, Rigby Flanagan-Bell</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike Flanagan ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
