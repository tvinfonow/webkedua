On Day 1, she received a “friendship” bracelet from Paul Abrahamian resulting in being safe from the first eviction. During the first week of the competition, she began a showmance with fellow contestant, Cody Nickson and voted to evict Christmas Abbott after Nickson, Head-of-Household at the time, nominated her for eviction. In week 2, Graf was named as a recipient of the Ve-toad curse after Abbott accepted a temptation offer voted by America, meaning she was required to wear a toad costume and jump between lily pads drawn on the floor of the house. After the pair were isolated from the house by an alliance led by Abrahamian, Nickson was voted out. In week 3 Alex Ow nominated Graf for eviction alongside Dominique Cooper, but she was spared from being voted out after Cooper started to get into fights with the other houseguests. In Week 4, Graf won the third and final temptation from America. She chose to accept the Halting Hex, allowing her to cancel any of the four subsequent evictions, resetting that week. She won the Head-of-Household in week 4 after Nickson, her showmance partner, won the Battle Back Showdown and reentered the house. She chose to nominate Ramses Soto and eventual winner Josh Martinez for eviction, expecting for Martinez to be evicted. She won the veto competition and chose the keep the nominations the same, but was blindsided when the remaining houseguests chose to evict Soto over Martinez. In week 5 Abrahamian nominated both Graf and Nickson for eviction, but Graf ended up using the Halting Hex that same week, sparing the duo from eviction. In week 6, Martinez won the Head-of-Household competition and while his initial target was Nickson, he managed to win the Temptation Competition, gaining immunity for the week. Graf purposely lost the same Temptation Competition to automatically become the third nominee, providing her with a chance to win the Power of Veto later in the week, saving her from eviction. She was unable to do so, ultimately being evicted by a vote of 7-1-0 to Raven Walton and Elena Davies, respectively.</p><h2>Jessica Graf Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jessica Graf is one of the <strong>richest Reality Star</strong> from United States.

The season began filming on the 1st of October, just eleven days after filming for Big Brother wrapped up. The duo quickly bonded with fellow competitors Kristi Leskinen and Jen Hudak, and Alex Rossi and Conor Daly. After placing 2nd to Kristi and Jen in the first leg, Jess and Cody managed to win the 2nd leg and a $5,000 cash prize. The pair conflicted with Lucas Bocanegra and Brittany Austin and considered targeting them in the 6th leg but when they discovered that they were second-to-last, decided to U-Turn Trevor Wadleigh and Chris Marchant, the only team behind them, resulting in the latter’s elimination. In the 8th leg, Lucas and Brittany chose to U-Turn Cody and Jessica, but they were able to still make it to the Pit Stop before Eric and Daniel Guiffreda, narrowly avoiding elimination. Despite coming in 2nd place for most of the final leg, Graf was able to finish the final task before the two other remaining teams, ultimately taking out the entire season and winning the $1,000,000 grand prize. Throughout the entire race, they managed to never place below 6th, achieving the 2nd highest average placement, behind Kristi and Jen. Jessica Graf and Cody Nickson are the first Amazing Race team from another CBS franchise to win The Amazing Race.</p><h2>Who is Jessica Graf Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jessica Graf</strong> married to <strong>Cody Nickson </strong>.
