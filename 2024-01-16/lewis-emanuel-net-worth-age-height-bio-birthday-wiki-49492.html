Lewis James Emanuel, born 4 October 1983, is a former professional footballer. He played as a leftback or as a midfielder.&nbsp;He was a player for Brentford, Luton Town, and Bradford City.&nbsp;After playing more than 200 games, he retired in 2010.&nbsp;Emaunel was sentenced to eight years in prison for his role in an armed robbery three years after he had finished his playing career.</p><p>Emanuel participated in pre-season friendlies with Southend United and Birmingham City in July and August 2008.&nbsp;Emanuel was still at Kenilworth Road during the 2008-09 season. Luton was therefore deducted 30 points.&nbsp;Emanuel was able to help Luton reach zero points in January’s 2-2 draw against Chester City. However, he was injured and had to be substituted in the second half.&nbsp;Emanuel was later diagnosed with a ruptured medial ligament and was likely to be out for the remainder of the season.&nbsp;Due to injury, Emanuel played only 14 games for Luton in the entire season.&nbsp;He returned to training sooner than expected, and he played for Luton’s reserves team in March. Later that week, he was back in the first team against Aldershot Town.&nbsp;Emanuel, a month after his return, was part of Luton’s Football League Trophy-winning squad. They defeated Scunthorpe United 3-1 after extra time at Wembley Stadium.</p><p>Emanuel was given the opportunity to return to pre-season training in for the 2010–11 campaign and prove his fitness. However, he failed to report for the training sessions and was consequently released from Luton in early July 2010. He joined Barrow on trial shortly after his release, though was not offered a contract due to impending surgery on his toe injury.</p><p>On 1 June 2013, Emanuel was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery at a post office in Skelmanthorpe, West Yorkshire. He was later charged and remanded in custody on 15 June. In December 2013 Emanuel was sentenced to eight years in prison having pleaded guilty to robbery and possession of an imitation firearm.</p><p align=justify>Kevin Blackwell, the new Luton manager, preferred his own signings Alan Goodall (and Darren Currie) to Emanuel after Luton was relegated to League One.&nbsp;Under Blackwell’s management, he only played two games and neither in the league.&nbsp;He joined Brentford on a one-month loan agreement, which was then extended for another month.&nbsp;After claiming that he had lost the M25, he missed a League Two match against Morecambe during his loan period.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lewis Emanuel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lewis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Emanuel</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bradford</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lewis Emanuel ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
