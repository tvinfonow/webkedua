Three-time All-Star who won two World Series titles with the Cincinnati Reds.</p><p>His son <a href=#>Ken Griffey Jr.</a> hit over 600 home runs in his productive MLB career.</p><p>A three-time All-Star, Griffey hit over .300 five times in his role as the table-setter for the powerful Cincinnati batting order that was known as the Big Red Machine for their dominance of the National League in the mid-1970s. In 2004, Griffey was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. He is the father of Hall of Fame outfielder Ken Griffey Jr.</p><p>Griffey made his MLB debut on August 25, 1973, with the Cincinnati Reds. That season, Griffey played in only 25 games, but batted .384 with three homers. The following season, Griffey saw more playing time with 88 games. In 1975, Griffey began to break out with a .305 batting average with four home runs and 46 RBIs. Griffey’s best season came in 1976, when he came just short of winning the batting title behind Bill Madlock of the Chicago Cubs. Griffey chose to sit out the final day of the season to protect his batting title and it came back to haunt him as Madlock collected four hits that same day. Griffey entered the game late after hearing the news, and went 0 for 2. Many baseball purists were disappointed in Griffey (and perhaps more so in his manager, Sparky Anderson, for choosing to sit him out to gain an individual accolade). Griffey finished with a career high .336. He also finished eighth in the Most Valuable Player voting, and was named to The Sporting News National League All-Star team.</p><p align=justify>He had two sons with his wife Alberta.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ken Griffey Sr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ken</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Donora</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Robert Joseph Griffey, Ruth Griffey</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Valarie Griffey</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ken Griffey Jr., Craig Griffey</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ken Griffey Sr. ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In a 2016 interview with ESPN, he said he did not see his father again until he was 16. His contemporaries in Donora did not think he would become a baseball star; they considered his best sport to be football, where he was a star wide receiver. Griffey himself considered football to be his best sport, followed by basketball, track, and only then baseball. At times, he would even compete in track meets during baseball games, rushing up the hill between Donora High School’s baseball field and track between at-bats when it came time for his track events. However, as his high school graduation in 1969 neared, he discovered his girlfriend was pregnant. He would soon be chosen by the Reds in the 1969 draft, signed with the organization, and married his girlfriend. After his first minor-league season, Ken Jr. was born. While Ken Sr. left Donora in 1972 as his professional career advanced, he retains close ties to the town, making frequent visits to this day.</p><h3>Is Ken Griffey Sr in the Hall of Fame?</h3><p>Griffey was <b>inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2004</b>, and now resides in Winter Garden, Florida.</p><h3>How long did Griffey Jr and Sr play together?</h3><p>The exceptionally talented family pair played together for <b>two seasons</b>, in 1990 and 1991, as Senior’s career was winding down and Junior’s path to the Hall of Fame was beginning.
