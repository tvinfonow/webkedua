Who is Rob Johnson dating now & how much money does Rob Johnson have?</p><h2>Rob Johnson Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Rob Johnson</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>American Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>March 18, 1973</strong> in Newport Beach, Newport Beach, <strong>United States</strong>. Rob Garland Johnson (born March 18, 1973) is a former professional American football quarterback and current assistant football coach at Mission Viejo High School. Johnson, a native of Orange County, California, played college football at the University of Southern California (USC) and was a fourth-round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft by the expansion team Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>With USC, Johnson won the 1995 Cotton Bowl Classic. In the Jaguars’ opening game of 1997, Johnson started for an injured Mark Brunell and had a breakout performance that set a record for the best completion percentage by a debuting starting quarterback. Johnson signed a $25 million contract with the Buffalo Bills the following season and was named starting quarterback by coach Wade Phillips. Johnson had a tumultuous, injury-ridden run with the Bills and a reputation for frequently being sacked (140 in his career, including 49 in 2000), the inspiration for the nickname “Robo-sack”. Johnson’s injuries and poor performance led Phillips to replace Johnson with the more experienced Doug Flutie as starter. Controversially, Phillips started Johnson over Flutie for the 2000 Wild Card playoff game that the Bills lost to eventual AFC champion Tennessee Titans, after Flutie helped the Bills to an 11–5 record in the 1999 season. Phillips later said that Bills’ owner Ralph Wilson had instructed the head coach to start Johnson over Flutie.</p><p>For the final two games of the 1997 preseason, Johnson was the starter in place of an injured Brunell and won both games. Johnson started his first game on Week 1 of 1997 as Brunell was still recovering. In that game on August 31, 1997, Johnson completed 20 of 24 passes for 294 yards and two touchdowns. For the Jaguars’ first two possessions, Johnson led 84- and 93-yard touchdown drives. Johnson also ran four times for 31 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown on a scramble. Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith caught the winning 28-yard touchdown pass from Johnson in the Jaguars’ 28–27 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. This performance set the record for the highest completion percentage of any first-time starting quarterback. Twice in the game, Johnson left due to high ankle sprains. Due to his ankle injury, Johnson would miss the next three games. In Week 7 (October 12), Johnson played his next game of the season, a backup role to Brunell in a 38–21 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Johnson completed one 10-yard pass and was sacked once for 6 yards. For three more games, Johnson would play in minor roles: a week 9 (October 26) loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, a week 11 (November 9) win over the Kansas City Chiefs, and a week 17 (December 21) win over the Oakland Raiders for a cumulative five games played in 1997 (including one start). Johnson did not play in the Jaguars’ only postseason game, a 17–42 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XXXII champion Denver Broncos in the Wild Card round.</p><p>With the Bills facing the Indianapolis Colts in week 5, Johnson suffered a separated rib cartilage during the first quarter and left the game. Appearing in relief, Flutie led the Bills to a 31–24 victory over the Colts with 24 unanswered points in the second half. While Johnson was still recovering from his injury, Flutie led the Bills to four consecutive wins before Phillips officially named him the new starting quarterback on November 5, 1998. Speaking to the media following the announcement, Johnson publicly expressed his displeasure, erroneously saying, “I’m not a backup.” Flutie led the Bills to a 10–6 record before losing to the Miami Dolphins in the first round of the playoffs.</p><p align=justify>Johnson played college football at the University of Southern California, where he was teammates with Keyshawn Johnson, Curtis Conway, Johnnie Morton, Willie McGinest, and All America tackle and fellow Jacksonville Jaguars draftee Tony Boselli. Johnson left USC holding virtually every major passing record and spent much of his senior year as a Heisman Trophy candidate. In his final game for the school, Johnson led his team to victory in the 1995 Cotton Bowl Classic, dominating Texas Tech by a final score of 55–14.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rob Johnson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rob</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rob</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Newport Beach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Newport Beach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bob Johnson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bret Johnson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rob Johnson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Johnson was immediately named the starting quarterback after signing a five-year, $25 million contract with the team. First-year Bills’ head coach Wade Phillips proclaimed Johnson’s arrival as the start of a “new era” for the franchise.</p><h2>Rob Johnson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Rob Johnson is one of the <strong>richest American Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Rob Johnson</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Johnson was born in Newport Beach, California and graduated from El Toro High School in 1991. In his senior season of 1990, Johnson completed 207 of 303 attempted passes for 2,788 yards and 28 touchdowns. The Los Angeles Times selected Johnson as first-team All-Orange County.</p><p align=justify>In the 1995 NFL Draft, the expansion team Jacksonville Jaguars drafted Johnson as the first draft pick of the fourth round (99th overall). As a rookie, Johnson was the second- and third-string quarterback behind Steve Beuerlein. Johnson played in one game in 1995, a 44–0 loss to the Detroit Lions. With 3:57 remaining in the third quarter, Johnson entered the game for Beuerlein. In three drives, Johnson threw one interception and failed at two fourth down conversions. Johnson was 3 for 7 in passing for 24 yards, one interception, and one sack, and he rushed for 17 yards. The Jaguars finished their inaugural season 4–12.</p><p align=justify>Starting in 1996, Mark Brunell became starting quarterback for the Jaguars. Rob Johnson played in all the preseason games and completed 30 of 43 passes (69.8%) for 336 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions. He rushed for 23 yards, including a 7-yard touchdown run against the San Francisco 49ers. Johnson did not play in any regular season or postseason games in 1996. The Jaguars finished the 1996 season 9–7 and lost the AFC championship game to the New England Patriots.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Facing the Titans on the road, Johnson played poorly, completing only 10 of 22 passes for 131 yards, taking six sacks, and fumbling three times. However, the Bills still led 16-15 after a Steve Christie field goal with 16 seconds remaining. On the ensuing kickoff, however, Titans tight end Frank Wycheck completed a pass that was ultimately ruled to be a lateral to returner Kevin Dyson, who returned the ball for a touchdown and the Titans victory. This play would be known later as “Home Run Throwback” or the “Music City Miracle”. The Bills did not make the playoffs after the 1999 season until the 2017 season.</p><p>Entering training camp for the 1999 season, Phillips named Johnson and Flutie “co-number ones” before ultimately awarding Flutie the starting job. Flutie led the Bills to a 10–5 record before Phillips decided to rest him for the final week of the season. Facing the Indianapolis Colts and the Colts’ second-year quarterback and number-one draft pick Peyton Manning, Johnson completed 24 of 32 passes for 287 yards and 2 touchdowns as the Bills won 31–6, ending the Colts’ 11-game winning streak. This performance led owner Ralph Wilson to “discuss” the QB position with Phillips, on the day after the game Phillips named Johnson the starter for the Bills’ opening round playoff game against the Tennessee Titans.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Rob Johnson height</b> Not available right now.

Facing the San Diego Chargers in week 1 of the 1998 season, Johnson left with a concussion. With the Bills trailing 10–0, backup quarterback Doug Flutie led two scoring drives, but the Bills lost 16–14. Over the first four games of the year, Johnson completed 63.2% of his passes with five touchdowns and three interceptions. He was sacked 24 times, as the Bills stumbled to a 1–3 start.</p><p align=justify>Rob Johnson started the first six games of 2000 and finished those games 3–3 after a 2–0 start as Doug Flutie recovered from a groin injury that forced him to miss much of training camp. The Bills’ opening game of the season was against the Tennessee Titans, a rematch of last season’s Wild Card playoff game. With nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, Johnson left the game with a leg injury, and Alex Van Pelt took over and set up the winning field goal for a 16–13 Bills victory. Johnson completed 9 of 18 pass attempts for 107 yards and one touchdown and rushed six times for 60 yards. However, Johnson was sacked five times. The following game against the Brett Favre-led Green Bay Packers, Johnson again was sacked five times but led the Bills to a 27–18 victory, on 18-for-26 passing for 259 yards. The Bills lost their next three games. In the week 6 game against the Miami Dolphins, a 13–22 loss, Johnson was sacked five times and finished 11-for-26 for 178 yards before leaving due to tendinitis. Johnson’s injury provided the opportunity for Doug Flutie to play for the first time this season, and Johnson had been sacked 25 times by the time of his injury. The Bills snapped the three-game losing streak with a 27–24 overtime win against the San Diego Chargers, but Johnson separated his right shoulder during the first play of the Bills’ opening drive in overtime and was expected to miss two to four weeks. Flutie led the winning offensive drive that game. With Johnson out with his shoulder injury, Flutie led the Bills to a near-upset of the then-undefeated Vikings, 31-27, then engineered an upset 20-17 win over the New York Jets and a 16-13 overtime win over the New England Patriots. Johnson returned in Week 11 against the Bears and received some playing time off the bench as Flutie led the Bills to another win.</p><h2>Who is Rob Johnson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Rob Johnson</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Johnson threw two touchdowns (albeit one coming after a Chiefs player dropped an interception) and ran for the go-ahead score with 2:58 remaining as the Bills won over the Chiefs, 21-17. After this win, which put the Bills at 7-4 and in playoff contention, Johnson began to struggle. The Bills lost to the Bucs, 31-17, in Tampa Bay in Week 13, despite two touchdown passes from Johnson before being injured again when Bucs linebacker Derrick Brooks threw him to the ground while he miraculously completed a screen pass to running back Shawn Bryson. The following week against the Dolphins, Johnson was only 6-18 for 44 yards with 2 interceptions and was benched late in the game for Flutie as the Bills lost, 33-6. A Week 15 Monday Night loss to the Colts eliminated the Bills from the playoffs, as it gave the Bills their seventh loss of the season, while all teams that made the playoffs in 2000 lost six games or fewer. Early in the Bills’s next game against the Patriots, Johnson received a season-ending injury, and Flutie replaced him for the remainder of the season.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Rob Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular American Football Player</strong>.
