His success in mainstream rock and metal ultimately helped secure Mr. Bungle a record deal with Warner Bros. The band released a self-titled album (produced by John Zorn) in 1991, and the experimental Disco Volante in 1995. Their final album, California, was released in 1999. The band ceased being active following the 1999–2000 tour in support of the California record, although their disbandment was only officially confirmed in November 2004. Patton explained to Rolling Stone “I’m at a point now where I crave healthy musical environments, where there is a genuine exchange of ideas without repressed envy or resentment, and where people in the band want to be there regardless of what public accolades may come their way. Unfortunately, Mr. Bungle was not one of those places.”</p><h2>Mike Patton Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mike Patton is one of the <strong>richest Metal Singer</strong> from United States.

In the book, Patton was quoted as saying:</p><p>Patton married Cristina Zuccatosta, an Italian artist, in 1994. The couple divided their time between San Francisco and Bologna, Italy, until their separation in 2001. Patton once owned a home in Bologna and speaks Italian. Regarding his close association with Italy, Patton stated, “It happened after I got married. I married an Italian lady, and I had to get acquainted. Basically, it started with the language because her family and her parents didn’t really speak English. I had to learn the language, so I did that. The longer you spend in a place like that, it really sucks you in. It really envelopes you and makes you feel like one of them.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mike Patton height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Mike <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Faith No More’s The Real Thing was released in 1989.

Faith No More released three more studio albums before disbanding in 1998 (Angel Dust, King for a Day… Fool for a Lifetime, and Album of the Year). In several interviews, Patton cited the declining quality of the band’s work as a contributing factor to the split.</p><p align=justify>Patton’s other projects included two solo albums on the Composer Series of John Zorn’s Tzadik label, (Adult Themes for Voice in 1996 and Pranzo Oltranzista in 1997). He is a member of Hemophiliac, in which he performs vocal effects along with John Zorn on saxophone and Ikue Mori on laptop electronics.

He has appeared on other Tzadik releases with Zorn and others, notably as part of the “Moonchild Trio” alongside Joey Baron and Trevor Dunn, named after Zorn’s album on which the trio first appeared, Moonchild: Songs Without Words.</p><h2>Who is Mike Patton Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mike Patton</strong> married to <strong>Cristina Zuccatosta </strong>.
