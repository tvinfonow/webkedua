It would be better to say I was on the set of the film… I was in the scene when Edward looks out of a window to the neighborhood. For a split second he sees some kids playing – one of them was me. I was sliding on a yellow piece of plastic we used to call a Slip n’ Slide. They were long flat sheets with water coming out of holes and were popular with kids at the time.

It was great fun being on the set but it was really cold and they made us do it a lot of times”.</p><p>Nickolas Gene Carter (born January 28, 1980) is an American musician, singer and actor.
