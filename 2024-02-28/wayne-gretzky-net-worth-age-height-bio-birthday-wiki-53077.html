Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In this, Gretzky added his considerable influence as the preeminent NHL star of his day to that of the Soviets, who had also developed a more team-style of play, and had successfully used it against the best NHL teams, beginning in the 1972 Summit Series. “The Soviets and Gretzky changed the NHL game”, says Dryden. “Gretzky, the kid from Brantford with the Belarusian name, was the acceptable face of Soviet hockey. No Canadian kid wanted to play like Makarov or Larionov. They all wanted to play like Gretzky.”</p><h2>Wayne Gretzky Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Wayne Gretzky is one of the <strong>richest Hockey Player</strong> from Canada.

The couple had married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in Brantford, where Walter worked for Bell Telephone Canada. The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because its yard was flat enough to make an ice rink on every winter. Wayne was joined by a sister, Kim (born 1963), and brothers Keith, Glen and Brent. The family would regularly visit the farm of Wayne’s grandparents, Tony and Mary, and watch Hockey Night in Canada together. By age two, Wayne was trying to score goals against Mary using a souvenir stick. The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$250 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hockey Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When Gretzky was 14, his family arranged for him to move to and play hockey in Toronto, partly to further his career, and partly to remove him from the uncomfortable pressure he faced in his hometown. The Gretzkys had to legally challenge the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to win Wayne the right to play in a different area, which was disallowed at the time. The Gretzkys won, and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the Toronto Nationals, in a league that included 20-year-olds. He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the Metro Junior B Hockey League in 1975–76, with 60&nbsp;points in 28&nbsp;games. The following year, as a 15–16-year-old, he had 72&nbsp;points in 32&nbsp;games with the same team, renamed the Seneca Nationals.</p><p>Gretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 1978 World Junior Championships in Montreal, Quebec. The Canadian coach, Punch McLean, was originally skeptical of Gretzky’s ability as he was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of 16. He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and Best Forward honours. His 17 points remain the most scored by a 16-year-old in the World Junior Championships. Canada finished with the bronze medal.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Wayne Gretzky height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Wayne <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Gretzky learned much about hockey from his father on a backyard rink at his home. Walter Gretzky had been an outstanding Junior B hockey player. He cultivated a love of hockey in his sons and provided them with a backyard rink and drills to enhance their skills. On the backyard rink, nicknamed the “Wally Coliseum”, winter was total hockey immersion with Walter as mentor-teacher as well as teammate. Walter’s drills were his own invention, and were ahead of their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team’s practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing new to offer him: “I’d been doing these drills since I was three. My Dad was very smart.”</p><p align=justify>When he entered the league in 1979, critics opined that Gretzky was “too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the [NHL].” His weight was 160 pounds (73&nbsp;kg), compared to the NHL average of 189 pounds (86&nbsp;kg) at that time. But that year, Gretzky tied for first place in scoring, and won the Hart Trophy for the league’s most valuable player. In his second year in the league, weighing just 165 pounds, he broke the previous single-season scoring record, racking up 164 points. The next year (1981–82), at 170 pounds—still “a wisp compared to the average NHL player”—he set the all-time goal-scoring record, putting 92 pucks in the net. He weighed “about 170 pounds” for the better part of his career. He consistently scored last in strength tests among the Edmonton Oilers, bench pressing only 140 pounds (64&nbsp;kg).</p><h2>Who is Wayne Gretzky Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Wayne Gretzky</strong> married to <strong>Janet Jones </strong>.

The NHL did not allow the signing of players under age 20, but the WHA had no rules regarding such signings. Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the Indianapolis Racers and the Birmingham Bulls. Birmingham Bulls owner John F. Bassett wanted to confront the NHL by signing as many young and promising superstars as possible and saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect. However, it was Racers owner Nelson Skalbania who, on June 12, 1978, signed 17-year-old Gretzky to a seven-year personal services contract worth US$1.75&nbsp;million. Gretzky scored his first professional goal against Dave Dryden of the Edmonton Oilers in his fifth game, and his second goal four seconds later. Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal-services contract rather than a standard player contract in part because he knew a deal to take some WHA teams into the NHL was in the works. He also knew that the Racers could not hope to be included among those teams, and hoped to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving teams when the WHA dissolved, as well as any funds earned from selling the young star.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Wayne Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Hockey Player</strong>.

Although Gretzky played 79&nbsp;games to Dionne’s 80, Dionne was awarded the Art Ross Trophy because he had scored more goals (53 to 51). The season still stands as the highest point total by a first-year player in NHL history. Gretzky became the youngest player to score 50&nbsp;goals, but was not eligible for the Calder Memorial Trophy, given to the top NHL rookie, because of his previous year of WHA experience. The Calder was instead awarded to Boston Bruins defenceman Ray Bourque.</p><h3>Why did Wayne Gretzky get removed from the Hall of Fame?</h3><table><tr>Wayne Gretzky CC</tr><tr><td>NHL Draft</td><td>Undrafted</td></tr><tr><td>Playing career</td><td>1978–1999</td></tr><tr><td>Website</td><td>Official website</td></tr></table><h3>Who is the greatest hockey player of all time?</h3><p><b>Wayne Gretzky</b> shattered long-standing records, notably scoring an unprecedented 894 goals.
