He spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Brooks was raised Jewish but rarely attends synagogue. As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in the East Village.

In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history. His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.</p><p>Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times. He says that his experience on Chicago’s crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him. In 1984, mindful of the offer he had received from Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern at Buckley’s National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent lifestyle that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions, Bach concerts, dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut, and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.</p><p align=justify>In 1986, he married Jane Hughes, who subsequently converted to his Jewish faith and changed her name to Sarah Brooks.

The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or “new upper class” represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.</p><h2>David Brooks Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>David Brooks is one of the <strong>richest Journalist</strong> from Canada.

He has worked as a film critic for The Washington Times, a reporter and later op-ed editor for The Wall Street Journal, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard from its inception, a contributing editor at Newsweek, and The Atlantic Monthly, and a commentator on NPR and the PBS NewsHour.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: “We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity … It’s going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage.”</p><p>Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators. In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as “a witheringly condescending” column portraying Senator Harry Reid as an “unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence.” By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts. In 2015, Brooks wrote that “[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment” made in 2003 by President Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself. Brooks wrote “many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no.” Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a “fable” the idea that “intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war.” Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that “[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>David Brooks height</b> Not available right now.

In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth. He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: “He laughed … ‘[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek’…I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being ‘too pedantic,’ of ‘taking all of this too literally,’ of ‘taking a joke and distorting it.’ ‘That’s totally unethical’, he said.” Brooks later said the article made him feel that “I suck…I can’t remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.” In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got “nearly every detail” wrong about a poll of high-school students.</p><h3>Who is David Brooks wife?</h3><p>Wife</p><h3>How old is David Brooks?</h3><p>61&nbsp;years (August 11, 1961)</p><h3>What is David Brooks annual salary?</h3><p>Executive Compensation Of this total <b>$823,958</b> was received as a salary, $771,375 was received as a bonus, $0 was received in stock options, $1,049,717 was awarded as stock and $83,696 came from other types of compensation.
