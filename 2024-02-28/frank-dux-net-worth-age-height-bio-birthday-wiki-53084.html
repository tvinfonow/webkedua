His family relocated to California when he was seven, and he later attended Grant High School. Dux states that he was introduced to and trained in ninjutsu by Senzo “Tiger” Tanaka, whom he described as a “world-famous” teacher and the descendant of 40 generations of warriors. Dux says that Tanaka brought him to Masuda, Japan when he was 16 to train him as a ninja.</p><p>Frank William Dux ( /ˈ dj uː k s / ; born April 6, 1956) is a martial artist, fight choreographer and author. According to Dux, a ninjutsu expert named Senzo Tanaka trained him as a ninja when he was a teenager. He established his own school of ninjutsu called Dux Ryu Ninjutsu, and has said he won a secret martial arts tournament called the Kumite in 1975. His alleged victory at the Kumite served as the inspiration for the 1988 film Bloodsport starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Dux’s victory at the Kumite has been disputed, as has the existence of both the Kumite he described and Senzo Tanaka.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Frank Dux</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Frank</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kvinge</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Martial artist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Toronto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ontario</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Alfred Dux, Margaret Dux</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Frank Dux ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Dux wrote articles for the September and October 1980 issues of Black Belt magazine, giving advice on martial arts techniques including knife fighting. He was described as being “decorated for his blade fighting techniques in actual combat in Southeast Asia” and as holding black belts in “Taekwondo and other arts”. He also co-authored an article on knife fighting for Inside Kung Fu magazine in 1987.</p><h2>Frank Dux Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Frank Dux is one of the <strong>richest Martial artist</strong> from Canada. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Frank Dux</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Dux also alleged in the book that his father Alfred had worked for Mossad before the Second World War and also joined the Jewish Brigade in 1939. Nigel West says that Dux’s family history does not “withstand much scrutiny”, noting that Mossad was not formed until after the Second World War and that the Jewish Brigade was not formed until several years after Alfred is said to have joined it. Lieutenant commander Larry Simmons, a novelist who formerly commanded SEAL Team 5 and who had the same literary agent as Dux, posed with Dux for a photograph. Dux featured the photo in the book, with the caption saying he was “talking shop” with the SEAL Team leader. Simmons denied “talking shop” with him, adding that Dux was “not an American warrior.

He also asserts he was recruited by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director William J. Casey to work as a covert agent. His military records, however, show he was never sent overseas and has not received any awards; Dux states the military sabotaged his records to discredit him. He has been accused of falsifying his military service by authors B. G. Burkett, Ralph Keyes and Nigel West, and his claim to have worked for the CIA has been dismissed by Director of Central Intelligence Robert Gates, General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., Major General John K. Singlaub and Soldier of Fortune.</p><p>Contrary to his claims, Dux’s military records obtained through Freedom of information show he never served overseas, he has not been given the Medal of Honor or any other award, and that in January 1978 he was referred for psychiatric evaluation after he expressed “flighty and disconnected ideas”. Dux states that the military sabotaged his service record to discredit him. A photograph of Dux in military uniform shows service ribbons being displayed in an incorrect order, and the Medal of Honor he is wearing is the version given to members of the United States Army, rather than the Marine Corps. Questioned about the photograph in 1988, Dux told John Johnson from the Los Angeles Times he was not able to get the military to explain why he was awarded a medal from the wrong service, though in later years he changed his story to say the uniform was just a Halloween costume.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Frank Dux height</b> Not available right now.

According to Dux, he was the first person to be given permission to speak publicly about the event, and was the first Westerner to win the tournament, achieving several world records there including the most consecutive knock-outs (56) and the fastest knockout (0.12 seconds). The 1988 film Bloodsport is based on his alleged Kumite victory. At the time of the film’s release, he was operating martial arts schools in Woodland Hills and North Hollywood, Los Angeles, teaching his own martial art style, Dux Ryu ninjutsu, which is based on the Koga Ninja root principles of Ko-ryū, “adaptability and consistent change”. Dux worked as the fight coordinator for Bloodsport and also for the 1990 film Lionheart and the 1993 film Only the Strong.</p><p align=justify>John Stewart, the author of the 1980 Black Belt article that first described Dux’s alleged Kumite victory, expressed regret for writing the article in 1988, describing himself as “naive” for believing Dux and saying after the story was published he received information that “raised questions about Dux’s military career”. In 1988 Jim Coleman, then editor of Black Belt, said that Dux’s story was “based on false premises”, adding they could find no evidence of such a competition; he made a similar statement again in 1996. Kenneth Wilson from the Ministry of Sports in The Bahamas disputed the existence of the Kumite, saying it was impossible a martial arts tournament of that scale could have been kept a secret. According to John Johnson, an invoice for the organization that allegedly staged the Kumite listed Dux as its only point of contact, and the base of the trophy he claims to have won was bought by him at a local trophy store. Dux told Johnson to speak to a man named Richard Robinson, whom he said he had met at the Kumite. Robinson initially confirmed Dux’s story, saying he was invited to the Kumite as he was an undefeated wrestler at Lower Merion High School. Johnson later uncovered that Robinson had not attended that school, and had actually gone to school with Dux. Confronted with this information, Robinson responded “All right. I don’t know what to say … Frank was a buddy of mine when I was in L.A.”</p><h2>Who is Frank Dux Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Frank Dux</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Curtis Wong, an editor of Inside Kung Fu, doubted whether Dux’s alleged 56 consecutive knockout record was possible.
