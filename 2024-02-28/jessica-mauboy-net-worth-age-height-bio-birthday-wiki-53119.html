The media cited her previous Sony contract as grounds for dismissal, but since the contract had expired, Australian Idol producers refused to remove her from the show. Throughout the series, Mauboy continued to impress the judges with her performances.

The Journey debuted at number four on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for shipments of 35,000 units. In September 2007, Mauboy joined as the new member of the girl group Young Divas, replacing one of the group’s original members, Ricki-Lee Coulter, who had left in June to resume her solo career.

Alasdair Duncan from Rave magazine described Mauboy’s second studio album Get ‘Em Girls (2010) as “a more hard-edged take on R&B and pop than her debut, pumped full of hip hop beats, jagged synths and futuristic vocal effects.” Mauboy said that she wanted each song on the album to talk about a “woman’s needs”, and that the album’s theme was “very much about the empowerment of women and the domination of women.” Kylie Northover of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that Mauboy’s third studio album Beautiful (2013) featured “a mix of more dance-oriented tunes and her usual R&B sound”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jessica Mauboy height</b> <strong>5 ft 6 in</strong> Jessica <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 6 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the final ten-week, Mauboy received the first touchdown of the season from judge Mark Holden for her rendition of Christina Aguilera’s hit, “Beautiful”.
