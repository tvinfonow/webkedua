He also played on several Bolton solo albums. (Bolton later co-wrote the Kiss song “Forever”, from Hot in the Shade).</p><p align=justify>Soon after leaving Kiss, Kulick formed the band Union with John Corabi, Brent Fitz, and Jamie Hunting in 1996. Corabi and Kulick wrote what would become the first album, the self-titled Union, which was released in 1998. They proceeded with a nationwide acoustic tour to promote the album, featuring just Corabi and Kulick (both on guitar). Soon the full band went on a world tour headlining small venues in support of the album. Their second album 1999’s Live in the Galaxy, was a live recording with two acoustic tracks recorded in a mobile studio. The third and final Union album, The Blue Room (2000), was a more polished sound than the first studio CD. Union never officially called it quits (playing live shows every so often with guest drummers and bass players), but with Kulick playing along with Grand Funk Railroad, Corabi playing with many bands, most notably Ratt, and both members being tied up in solo projects, Union has been on a long-term hiatus.</p><h2>Who is Bruce Kulick Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Bruce Kulick</strong> married to <strong>Lisa Lane , Christina Kulick </strong>.

Kulick officially left Kiss in December 1996. Kulick was with the band longer than any member aside from the original foursome and drummer Eric Singer (Singer has done three discontinuous stints with the band). When Ace Frehley again left Kiss (in 2002, after the Kiss Farewell Tour), Kulick was not asked to rejoin, as Simmons and Stanley thought that Tommy Thayer (former Black ‘n Blue guitarist and Kiss tour manager) could capture/copy Frehley’s persona better than Kulick; however, Kulick continued to work with Kiss after his departure, contributing work to the Psycho Circus album.</p><h2>Top Facts about Bruce Kulick</h2><li>Bruce Kulick was born on December 12, 1953.</li><li>He played lead guitar for KISS from 1984-1996.</li><li>Kulick has also played with Meat Loaf and Grand Funk Railroad.</li><li>He released his first solo album in 2001.</li><li>Kulick has been featured on over 50 albums throughout his career.</li><li>He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of KISS in 2014.</li><li>Kulick is known for his technical proficiency and melodic playing style.</li><li>He has collaborated with many other musicians, including Michael Bolton and Billy Squier.</li><li>Kulick continues to tour and record music as a solo artist and with various bands.</li><li>His brother Bob also played guitar for KISS during the band’s early years.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Bruce Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Guitarist</strong>.
