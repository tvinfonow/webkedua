He almost qualified for the 2000 World Championships, leading eventual semi-finalist Joe Swail 9–6 in the final qualifying round before losing 9–10, but first served notice of his true potential by knocking out Stephen Lee in the first round of the UK Championship in 2002.</p><p>Maguire has a rivalry with Shaun Murphy. In a 2004 Grand Prix match, Murphy was involved in having one of Maguire’s frames forfeited. As the match was about to begin, Maguire realised he had forgotten to bring his chalk with him. He asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena. While he was away, Murphy spoke to the referee; the tournament director Mike Ganley was summoned and he docked Maguire a frame for not being ready to start at the scheduled time. Maguire later won the match 5–2. Later that year, whilst playing in the final of the UK Championships, David Gray forgot his chalk. However, Maguire let him get it without a frame being docked. After beating Murphy in the 2007 Welsh Open, Maguire said, ‘That put the icing on the cake, but we’ve always had a rivalry. I dislike him and I think he dislikes me. I try hard to beat everyone, but it would have hurt more if I’d lost to him.” Murphy currently leads the head-to-head 14–11.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen Maguire</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stergios</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oikonomikos</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glasgow</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scotland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Stephen Maguire ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
