Martin, she obtained the role practically without debate after an arresting audition at which she appeared already made up and costumed as Brienne. After being cast in the role, she prepared for it by working out extensively, taking horsemanship, sword-fighting, and stagefighting lessons.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Gwendoline Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Movie Actress</strong>.
