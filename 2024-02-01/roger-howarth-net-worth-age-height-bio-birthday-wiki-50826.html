Who is Roger Howarth dating now & how much money does Roger Howarth have?</p><h2>Roger Howarth Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Roger Howarth</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Soap Opera Actor</strong> who was born on <strong>September 13, 1968</strong> in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, <strong>United States</strong>. Veteran of daytime television, who has appeared in As the World Turns and General Hospital.</p><p>In multiple episodes of Dawson’s Creek, he acted alongside&nbsp;James Van Der Beek.</p><p>Howarth was discovered during a nationwide talent search and was cast in the role of Kent Winslow on the ABC daytime drama Loving. The role was short-lived. It was shortly after this that he was cast on the ABC daytime drama One Life to Live as Todd Manning, in what was supposed to be a day-player role, but became one of the genre’s most successful and enduring characters. The character has also been termed an icon by the press. Howarth portrayed Todd on-and-off since 1992. He was strongly praised for his work on the series, and won a Daytime Emmy Award in 1994 for the role. Subsequent attempts to rehabilitate the rapist character of Todd, however, unnerved Howarth. After a female fan shouted “Rape me, Todd!” at a public appearance, his ambivalence about the role deepened. After attempts were made to pair Todd and the woman he raped, Marty Saybrooke, as a romantic couple, Howarth quit the show in 1995. He subsequently returned, but Todd was portrayed even more as a villain than a hero. His character’s pairing with Kassie DePaiva’s Blair Cramer won over fans and the two later became a supercouple. While with the series, Howarth found time to extend his career to prime time, and was cast as the murderous Randall Lynch for 4 episodes of the sci-fi series Prey.</p><p>In 1998, Howarth departed One Life to Live for a second time, looking to pursue other acting projects both on Broadway and in Hollywood. He made his first Broadway debut in The White Rose, but also did some theater work in Henry IV, Passions, You Touched Me, Mother Courage, and Orestes. A prominent stage appearance for Howarth was in James Goldman’s Broadway production of The Lion In Winter. The play officially opened on Broadway on March 11, 1999 and ended with “its final curtain” on May 30, 1999. During the play’s run, Howarth appeared opposite Stockard Channing and Laurence Fishburne.</p><p align=justify>He had a son, Julian, and a daughter, Langston, with his wife Cari Stahler.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Roger Howarth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Roger</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Howarth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soap Opera Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hastings-on-Hudson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cari Stahler</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Langston Howarth, Julian Howarth</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Roger Howarth ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Howarth is listed as a full-time contract cast member.</p><p>Howarth, Michael Easton and Kristen Alderson appeared on General Hospital from 2012 to 2013. Their characters of Todd Manning, John McBain and Starr Manning would return to One Life to Live and likely be recast with new actors with the current actors receiving new characters once they return to General Hospital. Prospect Park owned the rights to all One Life to Live characters; TV Guide reported that because ABC does not want to risk any further legal disputes with Prospect Park concerning the characters, the only way to avoid such disputes may be to have the former One Life to Live actors portray “characters that in no way resemble the current ones” in order to stay on General Hospital. ABC announced that the actors would be returning to General Hospital on May 13, 2013, but without naming the characters they would portray. Howarth also continued to portray Todd Manning on Prospect Park’s online version of One Life to Live.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Roger Howarth height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Roger <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2000, Howarth returned to One Life to Live.
