The incident began with an attempt by union activists to tear down the Americans for Prosperity tent, which was eventually successful. During the altercation, Crowder was punched several times by a union activist. Crowder posted an edited video of the incident to his YouTube channel that cut footage of the alleged assailant being pushed to the ground and getting back up, right before throwing the punches at Crowder.

The New York Times stated, “The same footage also shows that Mr. Crowder had his hand on that man’s shoulder just before he tumbled to the ground, but, while the camera does not capture the whole sequence of events, it seems likely that the man was knocked to the ground as members of the two sides pushed against one other, not shoved down by Mr. Crowder.” Crowder later released an unedited copy of the video.</p><h2>Steven Crowder Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Steven Crowder is one of the <strong>richest Comedian</strong> from United States.
