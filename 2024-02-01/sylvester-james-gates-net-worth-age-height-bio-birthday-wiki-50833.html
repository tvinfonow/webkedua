T. Grisaru, M. Rocek and W. Siegel, Gates co-authored Superspace or One Thousand plus one supersymmetry lessons (1984) the first complete book on supersymmetry.</p><p align=justify>Recently, Gates has been included on TurboTax along with Verizon commercials. He has also been prominently featured in NOVA PBS programs on physics including “The Elegant Universe” (2003).&nbsp;He also produced a DVD called Superstring Theory: The DNA of Reality (2006) for The Teaching Company consisting of 24 half-hour talks to make the complex nature of unification theory understandable for people who are not experts.&nbsp;The 2008 World Science Festival, Gates presented his performance of the ballet “The Elegant Universe”, in which he presented an opening public presentation of artistic expressions that are a part of his research.&nbsp;Gates was a guest at the 2011, Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate the Theory of Everything, hosted by Neil DeGrasse Tyson.&nbsp;Gates was also on The BBC Horizon documentary The Hunt for Higgs in 2012.&nbsp;Gates was recently featured in another NOVA document “Big Bang Machine” in 2015.</p><p align=justify>Gates, the oldest of four siblings, was born in Tampa, Florida, the son of Sylvester James Gates, Sr., a career U.S. Army man, and Charlie Engels Gates. His mother died when he was 11. When his father remarried, his new stepmother, a teacher, brought books into the home and emphasized the importance of education. The family moved many times while Gates was growing up, but, as he was entering 11th grade, settled in Orlando, Florida, where James attended Jones High School—his first experience in a segregated African-American school. Comparing his own school’s quality to neighboring white schools, “I understood pretty quickly that the cards were really stacked against us.” Nevertheless, an 11th grade course in physics established Gates’ career interest in that field, especially its mathematical side. At his father’s urging, he applied for admission to MIT.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Physicist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sylvester James Gates height</b> Not available right now.
