According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Matt Carpenter</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He played college baseball for Texas Christian University.</p><p align=justify>He was a member of the 2011 World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals.</p><p align=justify>Including his fifth career leadoff home run against Cincinnati on April 19, Carpenter recorded his seventh straight two-hit game. Also the seventh consecutive game with an extra base hit, it was just the 37th occasion in the previous century in which a Cardinal achieved this feat. Further, the seven consecutive multi-hit games with at least one extra base hit in each tied the Cardinals’ franchise record which Ripper Collins originally set in 1935. That same streak was the longest in the Major Leagues since Paul Molitor achieved the same as a member of the Brewers in 1991. From April 12–19, Carpenter netted a .480 average, .880 SLG, seven doubles, one HR, and five RBI. His 22 total bases led the NL. MLB subsequently named him to his first NL Player of the Week Award for that period. Carpenter continued his extra-base hit surge. He ripped his second leadoff HR of the season against Washington on April 22, and, the next day, lined the first pitch of the game off Max Scherzer for a double.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In a June 4 matchup against the Kansas City Royals, Carpenter raked five hits in five at-bats to raise his batting average to a season-high .307. His double in the eleventh inning provided the game-winning RBI in a 5–2 victory. It was the first five-hit game for the Cardinals since Ryan Ludwick’s on September 4, 2009. Carpenter finished that game having reached base in 10 consecutive plate appearances. The five hits brought him into a tie for the NL lead in hits (73), and to that point, he led NL leadoff hitters in runs (40) and BB (33). After first-half results through July 6 including a .282 batting average, four HR, 32 RBI, and a .375 OBP, he was selected to his second All-Star Game at Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p><p>The St. Louis Cardinals selected Carpenter in the 13th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. Due to advanced age stemming from his redshirt senior season at TCU, he had little leverage in negotiations, and was forced to settle for a $1,000 bonus. He spent his first professional season with various A-level teams, including the Batavia Muckdogs, Quad Cities River Bandits, and the Palm Beach Cardinals Between the three clubs, he batted .283 with two home runs and 22 RBIs. In 2010, Carpenter returned to Palm Beach to begin the year; over 28 games, he hit .283 while also drawing 26 walks, placing his OBP at .441.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Matt Carpenter height</b> <strong>6 feet 3 inches</strong> Matt <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 3 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Matthew Martin Lee Carpenter (born November 26, 1985) is an American professional baseball infielder for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB).
