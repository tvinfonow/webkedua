It started out as a small business that used computer animation to make their films. Eventually, Phil Vischer and Nawrocki created VeggieTales and renamed the company to Big Idea Productions. The “Big Idea” for Vischer, was to teach children about right-from-wrong using God’s messages from the Bible. The characters they came up with were Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber. They chose vegetables to serve as the characters because they were easier to animate than human characters. A normal segment of VeggieTales would begin with both talking vegetables on a counter-top receiving a letter from someone asking about a particular Christian topic (selfishness, fear, lying, sharing, etcetera) followed by two short stories about the topic. In the middle of the segment would be a silly song. Not only would Vischer and Nawrocki serve as the producers and directors of the show, but they would also voice most of the characters in the franchise (the most by Vischer).</p><h2>Phil Vischer Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Phil Vischer is one of the <strong>richest Voice Actor</strong> from United States.

According to Vischer,”What’s in the Bible” teaches “Christianity in the same way Walt Disney taught America about space travel and “Our Friend the Atom” on TV in the 50s and 60s, and the same way Carl Sagan taught America about “The Cosmos” on PBS in the 80s”. Vischer hired renowned YouTubers Rhet McLaughlin and Link Neal to write, sing, and perform several songs about the books of the Bible for the series.

Their series continued being a hit in the market, but Vischer’s decision to take out a loan and produce their first full-length film, Jonah, caused the company to slowly fall apart financially. To make things worse, Big Idea’s termination of their association with their long-time distributor Lyrick Studios (the company behind Barney & Friends & Wishbone), caused Lyrick’s parent company, HiT Entertainment to file a lawsuit against the company for “breach-of-contract”. Vischer offered to settle with HiT for $500,000 but, HiT declined and the case went to trial after the judge denied Big Idea’s motion for summary judgement. A jury ultimately ruled against Big Idea in 2003, awarding Hit & Lyrick $11M. Although the verdict was later overturned on appeal, the damage was done and Big Idea filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in summer of 2003. After Big Idea was purchased by Classic Media in 2004, Vischer continued to worked on VeggieTales under contract as a writer until 2009 and voice actor until 2017 when his contract ended. Soon after Vischer’s departure, VeggieTales was cancelled.</p><h2>Who is Phil Vischer Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Phil Vischer</strong> married to <strong>Lisa Vischer</strong>.
