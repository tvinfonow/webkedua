When Glee was being cast, Monteith’s agent, Elena Kirschner, submitted a video of him drumming with some pencils and Tupperware containers. Series creator Ryan Murphy took notice of the video, but pointed out that he had to be singing, as auditioning actors for Glee with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act. Monteith submitted a second, musical tape, in which he sang, in his own words, “a cheesy ’80s music video-style version” of REO Speedwagon’s “Can’t Fight This Feeling”. He then attended a mass audition in Los Angeles; his vocal skills were considered weak, but he later performed very well with one of Glee’s casting directors, who said that his audition captured the most elusive quality of Finn’s: his “naive, but not stupid, sweetness.” Monteith said of his casting process, “I was like a lot of kids, looking for something to be interested in. Something to be passionate about. All you need is permission. Not only for Glee, but for anything in life.”</p><h2>Cory Monteith Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Cory Monteith is one of the <strong>richest TV Actor</strong> from Canada.

The actor said, “Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on, Finn’s not dumb anymore, really, he’s just a little naïve”. Early reviews of Finn from television critics were mixed; Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said that he and Michele were “both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet” in the pilot episode. Commenting on the fifth episode of the first season, Eric Goldman of IGN wrote, “We got to see a bit of a darker side to Finn […] it’s good to see this, because up until now, Finn’s been a bit too strait-laced to totally invest in”. In the second season’s eighth episode, “Furt”, Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly noted “It’s been a while since we’ve gotten some Finn focus, and I think I just missed Cory Monteith. But I also forgot what a good, natural actor he can be”. Monteith as Finn won the 2011 Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Actor Comedy, the same category he had been nominated for in 2010.
