In speaking with Bol, through a fellow Sudanese player, Lynam learned that he had become hesitant about playing professionally because he did not know the language well enough to understand coaches. Lynam said, “One of the things everyone was looking at was his passport. His passport said he was 19 years old. His passport also said he was five feet two.” When Lynam asked Bol about the discrepancy between his real height and his passport height, Bol said he had been sitting down when measured by Sudan officials.</p><h2>Manute Bol Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Manute Bol is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States.

According to Cleveland State University basketball coach Kevin Mackey, Bol could not provide a record of his birth date. Mackey listed it as October 16, 1962 on Cleveland State documents, but believed Bol was actually much older. Bol did not speak or write English at the time of his arrival in Cleveland. He improved his English skills after months of classes at ELS Language Centers at Case Western Reserve University, but not enough to qualify for enrollment at Cleveland State. Bol never played a game for Cleveland State. (Five years later, Cleveland State was placed on two years’ probation for providing improper financial assistance to Bol and two other African players.)</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$7 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Again with Feeley’s influence, Bol declared his intention to play professionally in the NBA. The Los Angeles Clippers drafted him in the fifth round of the 1983 NBA draft (97th overall). Clippers Coach Jim Lynam received a call about Bol from Feeley, whom he knew from coaching circles. “So, I said, ‘Have you told anyone else about this?'”, Lynam recalled. “Feeley said the only one in the NBA he had called was Frank Layden at Utah. He said Frank said he couldn’t take another big guy like this. He already had Mark Eaton. I was the second guy Feeley had called. I told him he didn’t have to call anyone else.”</p><p>With the NCAA questioning his eligibility for NCAA Division I basketball, Bol enrolled at the University of Bridgeport, an NCAA Division II school with an English program for foreign students. There he played for the Purple Knights in the 1984–85 season. His coach was Bruce Webster, a friend of Feeley. Bol averaged 22.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 7.1 blocks per game for Bridgeport. The team, which previously drew 500–600 spectators, routinely sold out the 1,800-seat gym. With Bol, Bridgeport qualified for the 1985 NCAA Division II Men’s Basketball Tournament.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Manute Bol height</b> <strong>7 ft7 in</strong> Manute <strong>weight</strong> <strong>91 kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>7 ft7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>91 kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Coach Don Feeley, formerly the basketball coach at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, traveled to Sudan to coach and held clinics for the Sudanese national team in 1982. Feeley eventually convinced Bol to go to the United States and play basketball.</p><p align=justify>Bol turned professional in May 1985, signing with the Rhode Island Gulls of the spring United States Basketball League. Going into the 1985 NBA draft, scouts believed that Bol needed another year or two of college, but Bol opted for the draft because he felt it was the only way to earn enough money to get his sister out of Sudan, which was in a state of political unrest at the time. In 1985, the Washington Bullets drafted Bol as the seventh pick in the second round (31st overall). He played in the NBA for ten seasons, from 1985 to 1995, spending parts of four seasons with the Bullets, parts of three with the Golden State Warriors, parts of four with the Philadelphia 76ers, and part of one with the Miami Heat.</p><h2>Who is Manute Bol Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Manute Bol</strong> married to <strong>Ajok Deng (m. ?–2010)</strong>.
