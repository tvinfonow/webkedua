Former college and professional football player who belongs to an elite group of athletes who have won both the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP distinction with the Michigan Wolverines and Green Bay Packers and Green Bay Packers, respectively.</p><p>He played&nbsp;He faced <a href=#>Drew Bledsoe</a> of the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI.&nbsp;of the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI.</p><p>During the 1991 season, after he became a Heisman contender, Howard decided that he would do “something special” during the Ohio State-Michigan game “as a little shout-out to the people back in Ohio”. After scoring in the game, in the end zone he wanted to do a backflip but, Howard later said, “chickened out”; instead he imitated the pose of the football player on the Heisman trophy bust, immediately receiving much media attention. Comparing his act to Muhammad Ali’s taunting of opponents, Steve Rushin observed that although Howard’s pose did not closely resemble that of the statue, “that looks more like the Heisman Trophy of our imagination than the Heisman trophy itself … thousands of people must have instantly picked up some object and tried to do the same thing”. Howard later said that “all of a sudden, everyone was doing it”; many have imitated the act, including fellow athletes, celebrities, and Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.</p><p>During his college career at the University of Michigan, Howard set or tied five NCAA and 12 Wolverines records. He also led the Big Ten Conference in scoring with 138 points during the 1991 season on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award and Walter Camp Award, earning first-team All-American honors. Howard captured 85 percent of the first-place votes in balloting for the Heisman, the largest margin in history at that time. Howard also earned a bachelor’s degree in communications in 1992. In 2011, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and he was honored as the inaugural Michigan Football Legend, a program honoring former players equivalent to a retired jersey number. Each Michigan player to wear Howard’s No. 21 jersey was to wear a patch recognizing Howard, and dress at a locker bearing a plaque with his name and time of tenure at Michigan.</p><p align=justify>His birthplace was Cleveland, Ohio which should make a bad smell in the mouths Ohio State soccer fans.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Desmond Howard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Desmond</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Howard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cleveland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rebkah Howard</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dhamir Howard, Sydney Howard, Desmond Howard Jr.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Desmond Howard ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
