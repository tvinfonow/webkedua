Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>From the age of five, Turner grew up alongside neighbour Matt Helders; they attended primary school, secondary school, and college together. At their primary school graduation ceremony, Turner, Helders and other friends mimed Oasis’s “Morning Glory”; Helders was Liam Gallagher while Turner “played” bass using a tennis racket. They met Andy Nicholson in secondary school, and the three friends bonded over their shared enjoyment of rap artists such as Dr. Dre, Wu-Tang Clan, Outkast, and Roots Manuva. They spent their time playing basketball, skateboarding, riding BMXs, and “making crap hip-hop” beats using Turner’s father’s Cubase system. Turner and his friends became interested in rock music following the breakthrough of The Strokes in 2001. His father let him borrow a school guitar to learn a “couple of chords” and, for Christmas that year, when Turner was 15, his parents bought him an electric guitar.</p><h2>Alex Turner Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Alex Turner is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Alex Turner</b>'s net worth <strong>$25 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He began playing guitar at the age of fifteen, when he was inspired to pursue a musical career.</p><p align=justify>His album Suck it and See reached #1 on the UK charts.</p><p align=justify>Kate Mossman of the New Statesman described Turner as “one of the great lyricists of the 21st century”, writing that his songs are “full of lovingly extended metaphors” and “mordant Morrissey-style observations”. Mike Laws of the Village Voice characterised him as “a writer without peer in virtually all of rock” and identified “rapid-fire prosody and facility with internal rhyme” as Turner’s trademarks. Simon Armitage, writing in The Guardian, said: “Of all those writing lyrics today, Turner is among the most poetic. His use of internal rhyme exists to be admired and envied … Turner is a storyteller and scene-setter.” “Like all the estimable British lyricists, be it Noël Coward or Morrissey, Turner has always been willing to risk a delicious irony or witty turn of phrase, even in a sad song.” Kitty Empire of The Observer considers him “probably the finest lyricist of his generation.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$25 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the summer of 2003, Turner played seven gigs in York and Liverpool as a rhythm guitarist for the funk band Judan Suki, after meeting the lead singer Jon McClure on a bus. That August, while recording a demo with Judan Suki at Sheffield’s 2fly Studios, Turner asked Alan Smyth if he would produce an Arctic Monkeys demo. Smyth obliged and “thought they definitely had something special going on. I told Alex off for singing in an American voice at that first session.” An introduction by Smyth led to the band acquiring a management team, Geoff Barradale and Ian McAndrew. They paid for Smyth and Arctic Monkeys to record numerous three-song demos in 2003 and 2004. Turner was quiet and observant during studio sessions, remembered Smyth: “Whenever anyone popped in the studio, he would sit and listen to them before he would say anything.” At their rehearsal room in Yellow Arch Studios, Arctic Monkeys developed a reputation as particularly hard workers; the owner lent the band touring equipment while the owner’s wife helped Turner with his singing. Barradale drove the band around venues in Scotland, the Midlands, and the north of England to establish their reputation as a live band. The band handed out free copies of the demo CDs after each show and fans began sharing the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk demo compilation online. After finishing college in mid-2004, Turner took a year out to focus on the band and deferred vague plans to attend university in Manchester. He began working part-time as a bartender at the Sheffield music venue The Boardwalk. There, he met well-known figures including musician Richard Hawley and poet John Cooper Clarke. By the end of 2004, Arctic Monkeys’ audiences were beginning to sing along with their songs and the demo of “I Bet You Look Good on The Dancefloor” was played on BBC Radio 1 by Zane Lowe.</p><p>At the age of 15, Turner’s weekends revolved around girls and drinking cider with his friends. Joe Carnall, a schoolfriend, has said Turner was “always the quiet one” in their social circle. After friends began forming bands and playing live, Turner, Helders, and Nicholson decided to start Arctic Monkeys in mid-2002. According to Nicholson, Turner already had “instruments about the house” and was conversant in the basics of musicianship because of his father’s job as a music teacher. Helders bought a drum kit, while Turner suggested that Nicholson learn bass guitar, and invited Jamie Cook, a neighbour who attended a different school, to play guitar. Initially, Turner played guitar in the instrumental band; he became the frontman when two other school friends declined to sing. Helders considered Turner the obvious candidate for lyricist – “I knew he had a thing for words” – and he gradually began to share songs with his bandmates. Before playing a live show, the band rehearsed for a year in Turner’s garage and, later, at an unused warehouse in Wath. According to Helders’ mother, who drove the teenagers to and from their rehearsal space three times a week: “If they knew you were there, they would just stop so we had to sneak in.” Their first gig was on Friday, 13 June 2003, supporting The Sound at a local pub called The Grapes. The set, which was partly recorded, comprised four original songs and four cover versions of songs by The Beatles, The White Stripes, The Undertones, and The Datsuns.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Alex Turner height</b> <strong>5 feet 9 inches</strong> Alex <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 9 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Turner was educated at Stocksbridge High School (1997–2002). His form teacher, Mark Coleman, characterised him as a “bright”, “popular” student who excelled at sports rather than music. His English and drama teacher, Simon Baker, remembered him as a clever pupil who was “quite reserved” and “a little bit different”. He noted that Turner had an “incredibly laid-back” approach to school work, which worried his mother and led to criticism from other teachers. While there were books at home, Turner did not read regularly and was too self-conscious to share his writing with others. Nonetheless, he enjoyed English lessons. Turner then attended Barnsley College from 2002 to 2004. Given the opportunity to “get away without doing maths”, he largely opted out of “substantial” subjects required for university. He studied for A-levels in music technology and media studies, and AS-levels in English, photography, and psychology.</p><p align=justify>Arctic Monkeys came to national attention in early 2005. They received their first mention in a national newspaper in April, with a Daily Star reporter describing them as “the most exciting band to emerge this year”. They self-released an EP, featuring the single “Fake Tales of San Francisco”, in May and commenced their first nationwide tour soon afterwards. In June, in the midst of a bidding war, Arctic Monkeys signed to the independent label Domino Recording Company. After initial sessions with James Ford and Mike Crossey, they recorded an album in rural Lincolnshire with producer Jim Abbiss. Turner began dating London-based student Johanna Bennett around this time. In October, the single “I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor” debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, Arctic Monkeys’ debut album, was released in January 2006, and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Turner’s lyrics, chronicling teenage nightlife in Sheffield, were widely praised. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times remarked: “Mr. Turner’s lyrics are worth waiting for and often worth memorizing, too … He has an uncanny way of evoking Northern English youth culture while neither romanticizing it nor sneering at it.” Musically, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that the album was influenced by guitar bands “from the past five years … Thrillingly, their music doesn’t sound apologetic for not knowing the intricacies of rock history.”</p><h2>Who is Alex Turner Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Alex Turner</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Turner was working as a barman at The Boardwalk in Sheffield in late 2004 when Clarke appeared on stage as the opening act for The Fall. The performance made a big impression on the eighteen-year-old: “He’s talking 100 miles an hour, and he’s really funny … It just blew my mind.” He was inspired by Clarke’s use of a regional accent and the early Arctic Monkeys song “From the Ritz to the Rubble” was his homage to Clarke’s style (“my best shot at it, at least”). Later in his career, Turner requested to interview Clarke for Mojo Magazine, published two Clarke poems as part of a single’s artwork and used another (“I Wanna Be Yours”) as the lyrical basis for a song. In 2018, Arctic Monkeys invited Clarke to perform his reading of “I Wanna Be Yours” at one of their Sheffield arena shows.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Alex Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rock Singer</strong>.

Alex Turner celebrates birthday on January 6 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In an otherwise positive review of a 2006 show, Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times noted that Turner seemed “a little spooked by the attention” and hoped he would learn “to reach out more to the audience” in time. In 2007, Kitty Empire of The Observer noted that he was a “reserved” presence on stage: “He chats a bit to about 15 people in the middle of the front rows, and only looks up at the balcony, once, a little apprehensively.” Following Arctic Monkeys’ headlining appearance at Glastonbury Festival in 2007, Rosie Swash of The Guardian remarked upon Turner’s “steady, wry stage presence”: “Arctic Monkeys don’t do ad-libbing, they don’t do crowd interaction, and they don’t do encores.” Simon Price of The Independent said Turner seemed “to freeze like a rabbit in the spotlights” during a headlining set at Reading Festival in 2009.</p><h3>Who is Alex Turner with now?</h3><p>The album became the eighth number one album of Turner’s career in the UK.
