Deco and Cila have two sons, João Henrique and Pedro Gabriel, who now live in Brazil with their mother. A few years later, Deco met Jaciara at a party in Salvador, Brazil, and divorced Cila to live with Jaciara in Porto. They married in April 2005 and now have a son, David, and a daughter, Yasmin. They announced their divorce in March 2008. In 2009, he married to his ex-girlfriend Ana Paula and she gave birth to his fifth child, a daughter, Sofia.</p><p>Born in São Bernardo do Campo, Deco spent time at Corinthians as a youngster, competing in the Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior for them. In the 1997 edition, Benfica sent Toni to scout the tournament, and he soon noticed Deco, recommending his signing. In June 1997, Benfica purchased his rights from CSA and immediately sent him on loan (along with fellow Brazilian Caju) to their farm team, Alverca. After helping them win promotion to the top tier in 1997–98 season by scoring 13 goals in 32 appearances, he returned to Benfica in July 1998. However, he left for Salgueiros in exchange for Nandinho, who went in the opposite direction. When asked by Nuno Gomes in an interview for FourFourTwo why he did not stay and become a legend at Benfica, Deco said, “Benfica decided, it wasn’t my decision. They didn’t want me. The coach was Graeme Souness at the time. I was young and Benfica needed some players.”</p><p align=justify>He was in a three-year relationship to his first spouse Jaciara Dias de Souza.

After completing six years of residence in Portugal, he was able to gain Portuguese citizenship and play for their national team. As none of his great-grandparents, grandparents or parents were Portuguese, under FIFA’s player eligibility rules his citizenship was the only factor to allow him to play for Portugal.

Indeed, many Barcelona fans met the transfer with raised eyebrows, as Deco was considered an attacking midfielder, a department which was already well covered. Instead, coach Frank Rijkaard used him in a three-man midfield, where his tactical knowledge, passing abilities and enormous work rate surprised many. In December 2004, he came second in France Football’s Ballon d’Or 2004 award, losing to Andriy Shevchenko and beating teammate Ronaldinho by six votes.</p><h2>Top Facts about Deco</h2><li>Deco is a retired Portuguese footballer born in 1977.</li><li>He won the UEFA Champions League twice with FC Porto and Barcelona.</li><li>Deco played for Portugal in three World Cups (2002, 2006, 2010).</li><li>He won the Ballon d’Or Bronze Award in 2004.</li><li>Deco was named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year in 2004.</li><li>He scored 20 goals in his international career for Portugal.</li><li>Deco played for clubs such as Chelsea, Fluminense, and Porto.</li><li>He won two Primeira Liga titles with Porto and one with Barcelona.</li><li>Deco made over 500 club appearances during his career.</li><li>He retired from professional football in August 2013 at age 35.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Deco Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Soccer Player</strong>.
