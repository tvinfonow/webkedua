He was selected in the fifth round (149th overall) by the Green Bay Packers.</p><p>For the first 3 seasons with the Packers, Levens was primarily a back-up halfback to starter Edgar Bennett. In the 1996 NFC Championship game against the Carolina Panthers, Levens had a break-out game, running the ball 10 times for 88 yards and caught 5 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown in a 30-13 win. In Super Bowl XXXI, Levens was the Packers’ leading rusher, carrying the ball 14 times for 61 yards, with the Packers winning their first Super Bowl in 29 years, 35-21. In 1997, Levens became the starting halfback after Edgar Bennett tore his achilles tendon in the 1997 pre-season. Levens rushed for over 1,400 yards and was voted to the Pro Bowl. However, he injured his knee again during the 1998 season and was never the same. He gained 1,000 yards for the Packers in the 1999 season, but was mostly used in a reserve role after that.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dorsey Levens</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Duke</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Thomas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Running Back</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Amaya</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Dorsey Levens ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>During the final game of the 1999 NFL season, Levens and the Packers were involved in what has been described as a bizarre tie-breaking scenario which resulted in four teams that finished with 8–8 records where two of the teams would qualify for the playoffs and the other two would be eliminated. Going into their season finale against the Arizona Cardinals, the Packers needed to win their game, have the Dallas Cowboys lose their game later that afternoon, and also needed the Packers to win the net points scored tie-breaker vs. the Carolina Panthers (who were facing the New Orleans Saints). The Packers and Panthers were playing during the noon time slot and the Packers held a net 18 point advantage. As the game progressed, Carolina was winning their game by a sizable margin to the point that they had overtaken the Packers in net points for a brief time. Since both teams were neck and neck for the tie-break advantage, both teams were frantically trying to score as many points as possible despite leading on the scoreboard by a sizable margin. The Cardinals and Saints also tried to score frantically as the game progressed to stop their opponents from gaining the net points advantage. Ultimately, the Packers prevailed in net points by +11. In the end however, the Cowboys won their afternoon contest against the New York Giants to claim the final playoff spot and thus eliminate the Packers from playoff contention. Levens scored four times during the contest. The Packers won their game 49–24 and the Panthers won their game 45–13.</p><h2>Dorsey Levens Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Dorsey Levens is one of the <strong>richest Football Running Back</strong> from United States.
