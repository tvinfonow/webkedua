Famous for co-writing hits like “California Gurls,” “Teenage Dream,” and “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.&nbsp;),” all hits by&nbsp;Known for co-writing songs such as “California Gurls,” “Teenage Dream,” and “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),” all hits by <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>..</p><p>She’s worked with many artists among them&nbsp;She’s collaborated with numerous artists, including <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>, <a href=#>Cher</a>, <a href=#>Ellie Goulding</a>, and <a href=#>Adam Lambert</a>.,&nbsp;Cher,&nbsp;Ellie Goulding&nbsp;along with&nbsp;Adam Lambert.</p><p>Bonnie Leigh McKee was born in Vacaville, California, and raised in Seattle, Washington. She studied classical piano and became a member of the Seattle Girls Choir Prime Voci at age 12, and toured with the choir throughout North America and Europe. She recorded two albums with the choir, titled Jackson Berkey Meets The Seattle Girls’ Choir and Cantate 2000. She briefly attended the Bush School, where she recorded a demonstration piece as part of a class project, before being kicked out soon after. At age 12, McKee’s mother gave a demonstration CD featuring her singing Bette Midler and Fiona Apple songs to a friend of hers, the co-founder of the Sub Pop label, Jonathan Poneman, who was intrigued by her songwriting talents. According to McKee, this was the moment when she realized she had to be “more than just a singer,” but a songwriter, as well.</p><p>Her debut album Trouble was recorded across a period of two years by producers Bob Power and Rob Cavallo, and commercially released on September 28, 2004. Reprise was unsure on how to sell McKee, so the label settled a partnership with internet radio website LAUNCHcast, which would promote the lead single “Somebody”. “Somebody” soon became one of the most played tracks on the website, and its popularity with young females led to a strategy where McKee would be a subversive alternative to the teen pop demographic. “Somebody” was performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, included in the motion picture Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!, and had a music video featured on MTV’s Buzzworthy and VH1’s You Oughta Know. Trouble received positive reviews in Blender, Nylon, The Los Angeles Times, and Teen People, but was commercially unsuccessful. McKee spoke about the album being unsuccessful, saying, “It was devastating when the album didn’t happen,” she said. “I realized there are so many steps from getting a deal to having a hit…and I didn’t get there. It was a huge letdown.” McKee began work on a second studio album, which never came to existence. According to McKee, she “downward-spiraled” and began to abuse crystal meth, an addiction with which she struggled for several years. She was dropped from the label after defacing the CEO’s car with lipstick during the middle of the night.</p><p align=justify>She was born into an musical family.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bonnie McKee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bonnie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>McKee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vacaville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bonnie McKee ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
