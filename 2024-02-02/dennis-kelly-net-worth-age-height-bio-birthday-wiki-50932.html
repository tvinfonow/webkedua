In an interview with The Guardian Horgan said “I guess there isn’t a moral centre because Dennis and I don’t have one.” Kelly then said “That’s scary. Fuck. We need to get a moral centre. Shit. It’s really true. But we do try to make sure we don’t get nasty for the sake of it. We make sure there’s a bit of heart. “</p><p>For the 2007 National Theatre Connections Festival, he wrote DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (better known by the title DNA) which after the connections received a professional production alongside The Miracle by Lin Coghlan and Baby Girl by Roy Williams at the National Theatre in the Cottesloe.
