The session also included Jacksonville native Mike Campbell. Benmont called Tom Petty, also from Gainesville, to ask for some help with some vocals. While they were taking a break Petty looked into the recording studio and thought to himself “this should be my band”. Petty had come out to LA with his band Mudcrutch, which Tench and Campbell were originally a part of, and had a recording contract. But once in LA the producers decided they were not keen on the rest of the band, so it broke up, leaving Petty basically a solo act — something he was not happy about. But because he had the record deal already, after the break Petty went back into the studio and started his pitch. By the end of the evening, Lynch and the rest walked out as Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.</p><p align=justify>Tom Petty had the following to say about Lynch, included in his 2005 book, Conversations with Tom Petty:</p><h2>Who is Stan Lynch Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Stan Lynch</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
