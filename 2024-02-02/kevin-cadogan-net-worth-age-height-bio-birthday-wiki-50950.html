A founding member of the band Third Eye Blind, he performed with the band from 1993 to 2000. He co-wrote some of Third Eye Blind’s most notable hits, including “How’s It Going to Be”, “Losing a Whole Year”, and “Graduate”, 10 of the 14 songs on their debut album Third Eye Blind as well as six of the 13 tracks on his final collaboration with the band in their second album Blue.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Cadogan and Stephan Jenkins signed a recording contract with Elektra Records in May 1996 which was later reported as the largest recording deal ever for an unsigned artist and launched Third Eye Blind into stardom. In 2011, Cadogan was honored on the show Pensado’s Place by record producer Eric Valentine.</p><p>The controversial circumstances of Cadogan’s departure stem from his allegations that Jenkins and he were to be partners of the corporation named Third Eye Blind Inc. Instead, Jenkins directed the band’s manager Eric Godtland and the band’s attorney Thomas Mandelbaum to issue Jenkins 100% of the shares to himself, making him the sole owner of all Third Eye Blind assets. Cadogan claimed that he was told by the band’s attorney that shares had not been issued to anyone. Cadogan told the New York Times in 1999 that he discovered 100% of the shares had in fact been issued to Jenkins as far back as 1996 when Cadogan and Jenkins signed the definitive record contract with Elektra. Cadogan states that upon learning that Jenkins owned 100% of the band he then refused to sign off on any more recording contracts and loans until shares were also issued to him. In 1999 Cadogan was asked to sign a $1 million loan from Elektra Records which would allow Third Eye Blind to record an EP and release it on its own label as a subsidiary of Elektra. Cadogan refused to sign the deal, citing the fact that he would not own or have any control over the assets acquired from the deal. In November 1999 Elektra Records issued the funds to the Third Eye Blind corporation without Cadogan’s signature as Elektra had previously required. Two months later in January 2000, Cadogan and Third Eye Blind parted ways after a concert in Utah. Despite having received the $1 million from Elektra in 1999, the band never delivered the EP for which the funds were allocated. Cadogan filed suit, alleging wrongful termination, adding that his production, recording, and songwriter royalties were withheld since being kicked out of the band. The lawsuit was settled out of court in June 2002, with the terms of the settlement undisclosed.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kevin Cadogan height</b> Not available right now.

All payments were subsequently directed in the record contract to be paid to Third Eye Blind Inc., effectively cutting Cadogan out of any partnership and making Jenkins the sole “owner” of the band. Cadogan says he was unaware that this change had been made in the contract.</p><p align=justify>Cadogan co-wrote 6 of the 13 songs on Third Eye Blind’s second album, Blue.
