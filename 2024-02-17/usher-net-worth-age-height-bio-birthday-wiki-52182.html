R&B singer performer who rose to fame after releasing his six-times Platinum-selling album My Way. His 2004 album Confessions became the fastest-selling R&B album in history.</p><p>He worked to help <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> rise to fame with their collaboration song “Somebody To Love.”</p><p>The boy band New Edition and its solo member Bobby Brown were childhood influences. Usher told ABC News, “I can remember as a kid attending a New Edition Concert”, and called it “one of the greatest moments in my performance history” years later when he was invited on stage with the group to perform “N.E. Heartbreak” at a concert in Washington, D.C.. On Bobby Brown, Usher told CNN, “the first record that I ever bought was Bobby Brown’s Don’t Be Cruel”, and that he admired him “Just for being an edgy artist, being a true representative of R&B and rhythmic music”. Usher’s Live album would feature a medley performance of Brown’s original singles – “Don’t Be Cruel”, “Every Little Step”, “Rock Wit’cha”, and “Roni”. Usher was inspired by Frank Sinatra’s My Way album released in 1969 so much that he decided to name his second album My Way. Prince would inspire “Nice & Slow” while giving him his first number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. Usher’s third album 8701 would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. His fourth album was inspired by rapper Eminem, who he credited for being transparent. Usher said in an interview with Sway Calloway; “the honesty of hip-hop and what Eminem was saying on his records it motivated me … there’d been other story tellers but never quite as vivid as his”.</p><p>Usher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, businessman, and dancer. He was born in Dallas, Texas, but raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee until moving to Atlanta, Georgia.

Usher recorded ten songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV, was only made available regionally and by mail order. However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a “bad experience”. The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.</p><h2>Usher Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Usher is one of the <strong>richest R&B Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Usher</b>'s net worth <strong>$180 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He started singing in his church choir at age nine and went to North Springs High School in Atlanta, Georgia. His first group was called the NuBeginnings.</p><p align=justify>His 1997 hit “You Make Me Wanna…” reached #1 in the U.K. and “Nice & Slow” became a #1 U.S. single in 1998.</p><p align=justify>On many occasions, Usher has named Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, “He influenced me in so many ways, more than just music . … . as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn’t be who I am today without Michael Jackson.” During the television special ‘Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special’, Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing “You Rock My World”. Prince being another main influence, Usher said “every album I’d always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he’s a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres.” In Time magazine’s “100 Most Influential People” issue, he explained “I was interested in music and trying to find a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn’t have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be.” Other musical influences are Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$180 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At age 13, Usher met A.J. Alexander at a local talent show in Atlanta. Alexander, who at the time was Bobby Brown’s bodyguard, would take Usher around and have him perform in parking lots and talent shows. Alexander invited Bryant Reid, an A&R representative from LaFace Records to see Usher perform on the television talent show Star Search. Following the performance, he arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid, the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher on the spot to a contract with the record company after Usher sang Boyz II Men hit record “End of the Road”. Usher’s mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career. Usher was introduced to the public on “Call Me a Mack”, a song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film Poetic Justice. During this time period, the young Usher first met Chilli of TLC, his label-mate whom he would later date.</p><p>On August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher’s self-titled debut album behind the co-executive production of Sean “P Diddy” Combs. Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was accompanied by three singles: “Can U Get wit It”, “Think of You”, and “The Many Ways”. The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date. The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex, and him only being 15 years old, the public had a difficult time believing that this was so. Again LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn’t as successful as they anticipated. At this time Usher’s mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately giving L.A. Reid more confidence in Usher.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Usher height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Usher <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Usher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (née O’Neal) (from Tennessee) and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. In the belief that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher’s family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, Usher attended North Springs High School.</p><p align=justify>After graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on LaFace’s version of “Let’s Straighten It Out”, a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist Monica; and on “Dreamin'”, from LaFace’s 1996 Olympic Games benefit album Rhythm of the Games.

From this point Reid didn’t know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with record executive Puff Daddy to “attend” what Reid called “Flavor Camp”. Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone, he described this period as the “hardest days” of his life. “I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York” he said.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Usher Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular R&B Singer</strong>.
