Kevin Hodges (born 12 June 1960) is an English retired footballer and manager who played as a midfielder, and now works as a coach. He spent the majority of his playing career with Plymouth Argyle of the Football League, where he is the club’s all-time appearance record holder. He also played for Torquay United and went on to become their manager before returning to Plymouth Argyle as manager. After a period in coaching roles elsewhere, he returned to work for Plymouth Argyle where he is currently responsible for managing the youth team.</p><p>Having initially been a player-coach and then youth-team manager at Torquay United, Hodges replaced Eddie May as first-team manager in the summer of 1996. He guided them to the Third Division Play-off Final in 1998, before returning to Home Park that summer to take up the position of Plymouth Argyle manager, replacing Mick Jones. His stint as the club’s manager was extremely different to the one as a player. The club were in the bottom division of the Football League, one which it was unaccustomed to, yet rather than bounce back up the club achieved mediocre league positions of thirteenth in 1999 and twelfth in 2000. The beginning of the 2000–01 season saw Hodges having to work with a tight budget and a team that needed rebuilding. After losing six of their first ten league games that season, Hodges’ reign was brought to an end, and he was replaced by Paul Sturrock.</p><p>He left his role as Plymouth Argyle’s academy director in November 2019.</p><p align=justify>His service to the club was rewarded early on in the 1987–88 season when a testimonial match was played in his honour against the club he supported as a child, West Ham United. Hodges became one of the few players to ever receive a second testimonial match in 1992, against Luton Town, after fifteen years of service to the club. He was loaned to Torquay United in January 1992, with first-team opportunities being limited at Home Park, to help the Gulls in their battle against relegation back to the fourth-tier of English football. Hodges’ final game for Plymouth Argyle came in the Second Division on 20 November 1992, as a substitute against Stockport County at Edgeley Park. He was then allowed to rejoin Torquay United on a permanent basis in December 1992, thus ending his fourteen-year association with the Pilgrims. He finished his playing career at Plainmoor, scoring 5 goals in 81 appearances before officially retiring in 1997, to focus on coaching.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin Hodges</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Broadwindsor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Broadwindsor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Trey Hodges</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kevin Hodges ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
