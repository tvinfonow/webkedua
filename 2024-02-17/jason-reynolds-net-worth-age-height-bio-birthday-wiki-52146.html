The book earned the pair an agent and then a book contract. Four years later they published My Name Is Jason. Mine Too.: Our Story. Our Way, a memoir about moving to New York to pursue their dreams, expressed through Reynolds’s poetry and Griffin’s illustrations. They published the book with the HarperTeen imprint of HarperCollins, working with editor Joanna Cotler (after Cotler retired, she referred him to Caitlin Dlouhy, who would become the editor on his next seven books). In the meantime, Reynolds moved home to DC in 2008 after losing his apartment in New York. He worked at a department store—the Lord & Taylor in Wheaton, Maryland—to pay the bills, going to a Border’s bookstore on his lunch break to see his book arrive on the shelf in 2009. Next he became a caseworker in a mental health clinic his father directed.</p><p>The book arose from personal conversations between Reynolds, who is black, and Kiely, who is white. The two met on a Simon & Schuster book tour in 2013, which coincided with the news that George Zimmerman had been acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin. Though strangers, Reynolds and Kiely began to share their feelings, each finding the other was “as frustrated as angry and as confused as I was”, as Reynolds put it. A friendship developed and the conversations continued with increasing urgency; after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, Kiely reached out to Reynolds to propose they write a book addressing police brutality and racial profiling.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jason Reynolds height</b> Not available right now.

He wrote a few lines in an effort to console his mother, who printed the poem on the program for the funeral, and after that Reynolds wrote poems as each of his grandmother’s siblings passed. Moved by these experiences of “the power of language”, he continued to pursue poetry through high school, graduating from Bishop McNamara High School in 2000, and college, even as he received poor grades and discouragement from professors in his English courses at the University of Maryland (he ultimately graduated with a BA in English.)</p><p align=justify>Eventually Reynolds returned to New York, again working in retail while he applied to graduate school, unsuccessfully because of his college grades. Nevertheless he began writing a young adult novel—”often while standing at the cash register when business was slow” at the Rag & Bone store he managed—spurred by his friend Chris Myers, son of Walter Dean Myers and himself an author and illustrator. Reynolds had told Chris he had basically stopped writing, but Chris pointed out that with his father aging (the elder Myers died in 2014), there would soon be a shortage of new works written about young black children, particularly black boys. He suggested Reynolds look at some of his father’s old works, and The Young Landlords particularly connected with Reynolds; the work gave Reynolds the confidence to “write in my voice, use my tongue, my language, my style, and write a story. Before that I always felt like I wasn’t good enough because I wasn’t Baldwin, or Toni Morrison, or Richard Wright,” but after reading Myers’s work, “the floodgates were opened.”</p><h2>Who is Jason Reynolds Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jason Reynolds</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
