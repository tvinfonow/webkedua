As Rascal Flatts watched that episode on their tour bus, bass player Jay DeMarcus was impressed with Gracin’s talent and reached out to him. He connected Gracin with Marty Williams, who had co-produced both of Rascal Flatts’ breakthrough album and its successful follow-up. That set in motion a series of events (with a short one-year break to finish his Marine stint) that led to a record deal with Lyric Street Records in 2004. His debut album Josh Gracin was released on June 15, 2004 and was certified gold. The album’s first three singles (“I Want to Live,” “Nothin’ to Lose,” and “Stay with Me [Brass Bed]”), all reached the top five on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, with “Nothin’ to Lose”, the second of those three, reaching Number One.</p><h2>Josh Gracin Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Josh Gracin is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.
