Later in the American DVD release, the name Jeff Stryker was used as well. A trailer interview was added with Stryker’s describing the experience he had while shooting this movie in Manila. Stryker also starred in the short film by German cult director Rosa von Praunheim Can I Be Your Bratwurst, Please? Stryker also appeared in a 1995 German television movie Der schwarze Fluch (Black Curse) starring James Brolin, as well as the 1988 Italian feature Dirty Love.</p><p>The Jeff Stryker Cock and Balls, a dildo fashioned from a cast of his penis, is widely sold in sex stores. The dildo was academically analyzed in a paper presented at the 1995 Bowling Green State University Conference in Cultural Studies: Lesbian Pornography and Transformation: Foucault, Bourdieu, and de Certeau Make Sense of the Jeff Stryker Dildo, by Mary T. Conway, then a graduate student at Temple University. The sex toy is notable not only for being popular, but also as Stryker and the manufacturer of the item litigated for the rights to its likeness as part of Stryker’s intellectual property. The case eventually reached a mutually acceptable resolution (see §&nbsp;Legal Battles). In a 1999 Salon article written by Jeff Stryker, a New York journalist and the porn actor’s namesake, the dildo is even described as an object of higher culture. It was mentioned in Allan Gurganus’ 1997 novel Plays Well with Others, where the novel’s narrator cleans up a closet filled with dildos, the premium find being “a Jeff Stryker, a monster, but somehow Roman in its genial fluted civic beauty.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeff Stryker</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nicolas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kocik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Porn Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carmi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rick Stryker</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Joseph Peyton</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jeff Stryker ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

I could see he had a pistol in his hand as he was dry-firing it… I’m willing to risk my life to keep this [club] going.” Stryker responded to Kulak’s claim and was quoted as saying, “That guy is so out there!”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jeff Stryker height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Nicolas <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>From 1999 through 2001, Stryker performed in a stage show called Hard Time, a comedy send-up of gay porn prison films.
