Her mother is Scottish, her father is English. She was meant to be named “Kiera”, the anglicized form of “Kira”, after Kira Ivanova, whom her father admired.

Macdonald also worked as a playwright after her career as an actress came to an end. She introduced her children to theatre and ballet at an early age.

To prepare for the film, she trained for several weeks in archery, fencing, and horse riding. Concurrently, she appeared in The Hole, a thriller that received a direct-to-video release in the US. The film’s director Nick Hamm described her as “a young version of Julie Christie”. Knightley also took on the role of Lara Antipova in the 2002 miniseries adaptation of Doctor Zhivago, to positive reviews and high ratings. In the same year, Knightley starred as a pregnant drug addict in Gillies MacKinnon’s drama film Pure. Co-starring Molly Parker and Harry Eden, the film had its world premiere at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. In a retrospect review for AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna noted Knightley’s screen presence and wrote that “[although Knightley] doesn’t have half of Parker’s ability […] she has spunk and grit [and] shines brightly in Pure”.</p><p>Despite having appeared in over a dozen film and television roles, Knightley struggled to get a breakthrough. That changed in 2002, when she starred in Gurinder Chadha’s sports comedy film Bend It Like Beckham, which was a smash hit both in the UK and in the US, grossing over $76.6 million. It also surprised film critics who were laudatory of its “charming” and “inspiring” nature, social context and the cast’s performances. Knightley and her co-star Parminder Nagra, who played the central roles of aspiring footballers, attracted international attention for their performances in the film. To prepare for their roles, they underwent three months of extensive football training under the English football coach Simon Clifford. Knightley, who was initially skeptical of the project, went on to win the London Film Critics’ Circle for Best Newcomer and the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. In an interview with Tracy Smith she said, “I remember telling friends I was doing this girls’ soccer movie […] And nobody thought that it was gonna be any good.” Film critic James Berardinelli, who was largely laudatory of the film and the “energetic and likable” cast, noted that Knightley and Nagra brought “a lot of spirit to their instantly likable characters”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Keira Knightley height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Keira <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Knightley began acting as a child on television and made her feature film debut in 1995, before making her breakthrough with the 2002 sports film Bend It Like Beckham, for which she won the London Film Critics’ Circle Award for Best Newcomer. She gained wider recognition for playing Elizabeth Swann in the 2003 fantasy swashbuckler film Pirates of the Caribbean. Knightley reprised the role in the subsequent films of the franchise; the second installment of the series made more than US$ 1 billion at the box-office, making it highest grossing film of her career.</p><p align=justify>Following the success of Bend It Like Beckham, Knightley landed the role of Elizabeth Swann, in the 2003 American fantasy swashbuckler film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The film, which was based on the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney theme parks, saw Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Johnny Depp play the roles of 18th century pirates. Despite boasting the names of Hollywood stars like Depp and Bloom and a hefty $135 million budget, Pirates was not the most anticipated release of the year, and was expected to fail at the box-office. Knightley herself was not optimistic about its prospects: “I remember being on set just sort of going, ‘OK, what is this? Is this any good?” However, contrary to the expectations, the film opened at no. 1 on the box-office, and went to become one of the highest grossing productions of the year, with the worldwide collections of $654 million.</p><h2>Who is Keira Knightley Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Keira Knightley</strong> married to <strong>James Righton </strong>.
