He was a television personality who called himself a “commodity for drag oddity”.&nbsp;He won the 11th season RuPaul’s Drag Race.</p><p>He was joined&nbsp;He joined <a href=#>Vanessa Vanjie Mateo</a> in the cast of RuPaul’s Drag Race.&nbsp;on the RuPaul’s Drag Race cast.</p><p>Oddly started doing drag during college in 2012 when Venus D’lite from RuPaul’s Drag Race hosted a workshop on the college campus for Valentine’s Day. “I attempted some drag (or ghost) makeup, put on a super-cheap red wig and dress, and backflipped my way through “Scheiße” by Lady Gaga. Her first performances were at Denver’s gay bar Tracks. Yvie Oddly came from her pun to express “being even odder than anybody else”. She soon developed a reputation for having “outrageous and unconventional looks on stage”. Her ingenuity came from financial necessity as making the “most glamorous or the most expensive” looks weren’t an option, saying that “I’ve just always liked to work with the materials that I have around me.” In 2014 she was an extra in the music video for Sharon Needles’s “Dressed to Kill.”</p><p>Oddly has been diagnosed with type 3 Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS). With her heightened status, she’s found a content community of people living with ‘hEDS’, and other invisible disabilities, who call themselves zebras as they have more exotic diseases than doctors would expect. The condition as well as the chronic pain of her “bones grinding” leave her depleted after performing so she foregoes post-show photo ops for more meaningful interactions.</p><p align=justify>Denver, Colorado is his hometown.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yvie Oddly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yvie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oddly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reality Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1993</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Denver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Colorado</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Yvie Oddly ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
