During the interview, Gragert asked Dessen about the style she uses in some of her books, otherwise known as “effortless perfection”. Dessen describes this term as the young girls in her books being able to have friends, look good, be a good student and have your life together and make it look easy. At the start of the book, the reader is supposed to relate with the main characters and throughout their changes in the book, the reader should see that it is okay to not have everything together and not be perfect. Gragert asked Dessen about her anxiety coping mechanisms because writing tends to cause an author to be anxious. Dessen said that she likes to exercise and read in her free time because all writers are going to be anxious, it’s part of the process, but it also opens their mind more because they see the world differently than readers.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sarah Dessen height</b> Not available right now.
