Crouser was born in Portland on December 18, 1992 and raised in Boring.&nbsp;Crouser is from a thrower family. His father, Mitch Crouser, was an alternate on 1984 Olympic discus teams, his uncle Brian Crouser qualified to two Olympic javelin teams, while his uncle Dean Crouser, a great shot putter and discus thrower was his uncle. He has two cousins, Sam and Haley, who are both javelin throwers.&nbsp;Although he started track and field in fifth grade he was not as proficient as his cousin Sam. He made his breakthrough in eighth grade and ninth grade.</p><p>Crouser, a Texas Longhorns freshman, placed fifth in shot at 2012 NCAA Indoor Championships. He also placed fourth in discus at the Outdoor Championships. Crouser sustained a hand injury at the NCAA Indoor meet and it also affected his outdoor season.</p><p>Crouser suffered from infections during the next off-season, and his weight dropped heavily; he redshirted the 2013 indoor season to regain full health. He returned to action for the outdoor season, throwing a personal best 21.09&nbsp;m (69&nbsp;ft&nbsp;​2 ⁄4 in) at the Big 12 conference championships; he won his first NCAA championship title in the shot put that summer with 20.31&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;ft&nbsp;​7 ⁄4 in), but only placed eighth in the discus. Crouser, who had been successful academically, began to struggle somewhat with the heavy workload during his second year at Texas; he had originally planned to major in engineering, but switched to economics after that year.</p><p>Crouser won his first NCAA indoor shot put title in 2014, throwing 21.21&nbsp;m (69&nbsp;ft&nbsp;7&nbsp;in) and winning by almost four feet.

Crouser won his second consecutive shot put title at the 2014 NCAA outdoor championships, with a heave of 21.12&nbsp;m (69&nbsp;ft&nbsp;​3 ⁄2 in), but injured his foot in the process; he had also qualified for the final in the discus, but was forced to scratch from that event.</p><p align=justify>Crouser was injured in his foot during 2010 and Crouser missed the entire season.&nbsp;Crouser returned to peak form in 2011, setting the indoor national high school record for the 12 lb (5.44kg) shot put at 77 feet 2/4 inches (23.54m).
