His primary opponent, Shane Osborn, questioned the depth of Sasse’s opposition to the ACA, publicizing articles and speeches Sasse delivered during and after the act’s passage through Congress; according to the Omaha World-Herald, “Osborn’s campaign appears intent on questioning whether Sasse is a true conservative.” The Osborn campaign cited, among other pieces, a 2009 Bloomberg Businessweek column titled “Health-Care Reform: The Rush to Pass a Bad Bill”, stating that “There’s an emerging consensus that this [an individual mandate] might be a good idea”, and a 2010 speech in which Sasse said Republicans would probably lack the votes to repeal the ACA, stating that “a middle-class entitlement has never been repealed”, and opining that Republicans had failed to offer a viable alternative, preferring to stage “symbolic repeal votes”. Sasse’s response to the Osborn campaign’s assertions was that in his articles and speeches, he was describing the political landscape rather than giving his own opinions on the merits of the ACA’s provisions; to a World-Herald reporter, he declared, “I have never changed my position on thinking Obamacare is a bad idea”.</p><h2>Who is Ben Sasse Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ben Sasse</strong> married to <strong>Melissa Sasse</strong>.
