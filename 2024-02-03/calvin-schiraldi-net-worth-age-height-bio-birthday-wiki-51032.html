Calvin Drew Schiraldi, born June 16, 1962, is a former Major League Baseball pitcher.&nbsp;He is most well-known as the losing pitcher in Game 6 and 7 of the 1986 World Series.</p><p>Schiraldi split 1985 with the Mets, Tidewater and won his first major league victory on April 22 against St. Louis Cardinals.&nbsp;Schiraldi, John Christensen and Wes Gardner were traded to the Red Sox for Bob Ojeda and Tom McCarthy. John Mitchell was also traded to the Red Sox.</p><p>With the International League’s Pawtucket Red Sox, Schiraldi was converted to a reliever. He made his debut with the big league club on July 20, 1986. With no outs, runners on first and third, and the Red Sox already down 6-3 to the Seattle Mariners in the Kingdome, Schiraldi replaced Jeff Sellers in the sixth inning. He allowed both inherited base runners to score, and gave up an earned run of his own in the sixth. However, he pitched a perfect seventh.</p><p>In 1987, Wes Gardner, who also came over from the Mets in the Ojeda trade, emerged as the primary closer for the Red Sox, though Schiraldi did have six saves. Following the season, he and Al Nipper were traded to the Chicago Cubs for Lee Smith. With the Cubs, Schiraldi was converted back into a starter, and went 9-13 with a 4.38 ERA in 1988. The Cubs shifted him back to the bullpen in 1989 before sending him to the San Diego Padres just before the August 30 traded deadline, with Darrin Jackson and a player to be named later for Luis Salazar and Marvell Wynne.</p><p align=justify>Schiraldi, who is also the head coach for the St. Michael’s Catholic Academy baseball team, in Austin, Texas, coaches the 17U Texas Fire travel soccer team.&nbsp;He is married to Debbie Murphy Schiraldi.
